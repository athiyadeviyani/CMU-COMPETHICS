    "## Overview\n",

    "The data for this assignment is available here. Your primary dataset consists of posts from Reddit. Each post is annotated with the gender of the post’s author (op_gender) and the subreddit where the post was made (subreddit). The main text of the post is in the column post_text. The contents of the provided data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `classify.py`: a classifier that predicts the author’s gender and the subreddit for a post (example run: `python classify.py --test_file dataset.csv`). Note that this file also uses the two provided pickle files.\n",
    "- `dataset.csv`: your primary data.\n",
    "- `background.csv`: additional Reddit posts that you may optionally use for training an obfuscation model. A larger version is available here.\n",
    "- `female.txt`: a list of words commonly used by women.\n",
    "- `male.txt`: a list of words commonly used by men.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided classifier achieves an accuracy of 64.95% at identifying the gender of the poster and an accuracy of 85.85% at identifying a post’s subreddit when tested over `dataset.csv`. Your goal in this assignment is to obfuscate the data in `dataset.csv` so that the provided classifier is unable to determine the gender of authors, while still being able to determine the subreddit of the post. Note that in this set-up, we treat the provided classifier as a blackbox adversary (please do not try to hack it). This assignment was largely inspired by the paper Obfuscating Gender in Social Media Writing (Knight & Reddy, 2016), which may be a useful reference. Scenerios where this obfuscation model might be useful could be social media users who want to preserve their privacy by hiding their gender from the adversary, without losing the meaning of their post. You could also imagine this is a dataset of health records or other sensitive information that needs to be anonymized before providing it to NLP researchers."
