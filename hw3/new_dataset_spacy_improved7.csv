Emotions for human ideals morality and social skills, but for practical situations and solving, they but obstacle. So there thing my girl and I have, she invented actually. We talk much when we *emotional* each other. If we debating something and things get heated and go for 30 minutes break. Its literally something around 30 minutes - we really count - we talk about something do something else. We stay still, we distract ourselves. Its kind automatic, actually. I thought it was weird first I tried, it would jeopardize communication, but thing: **when angry, sad, irritated something like that, youre actually listening, youre just talking. There communication. Its sided speech and there audience, to use words another.** - Bad things always bigger things. Someone something for once, twice, times, 29 and then... they do something bad. Boom, there go, down, they love, everything broke, why me? I wanna die, were and like that. There balance, little whole farm sick. Its like everything just something youre supposed to do, and indication care, but little indication hate. It isnt. People always up other. Mistakes human nature. **You do make happy about later**. If treat perfectly, why would else to? People make angry, specially ones who closer to you. You just got learn to let it go. Stop thinking about it? Impossible? No, it possible. Get something to do, something else, do to someone. Seeing someone smile help lot. Get mind things. You brain works repetition, **the think about something, important it for you**. If to think about it, focusing things, youll let it go. It take sometime and it come back every and then, but it much deal. - love about telling shit. Flowers and I love yous for TV and pop songs. Actual relationships about certainty. Do actually feel about having relationship with person? No, they make happy, stranger make happy accidentally. Hell, enemy make happy, they want you. **Does he something else can?** Is he valuable sharing emotions, financial issues, physical needs and life? This answer really hard, **most people just want someone makes them feel when they lonely**. A people do that. You with someone to stay happy, with someone makes happy. If happy alone, make happy. Seriously, cheesy line for blockbuster with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Its just mathematics. There someone when it comes to emotions. If want, literally make feel anything. You feel things, people just help prevent feeling them, but ultimately, feelings shit. If someone carries shit, relationship, slavery. So, just take it easy. Things going to blow up lay low. Breath, jog, CoD and take it Russians, read book and curse Oscar Wilde for so cool. Get something to take out and later see things werent so thought when were drunk with emotions. Uncontrolled emotions make forget things. When youre feeling thing, sometimes feel other. When angry, love anyone. Youre just angry. Let it pass. Its like trying to work when youre sick. Youre going to anything done, and youre going to get everyone mad, because youre bitching about ups youre responsible for. Go home, come back later. Close heart for repairs. Thats just my 2 cents, sis..."

Just...really about this a second. Is your here? At all, not in a best sense? Right here, you explicitly say that you dont setting boundaries with her. You say that *told you your face* that will **explicitly disrespect any boundaries YOU set, not your -- thus making the about & your husband, cutting you out.** This is manipulative messed up. She is not being about this. Her confession about manipulate the sow a seed of potentially ending up with your husband. If a good friend, distanced pushed get over this crush. I CANNOT emphasize this enough. This ENTIRE deliberately engineered by your so-called position between you your husband, exacerbate the difficult situations in your marriage, manipulate into the position of other woman. If you continue interact with in the same manner as before, **she will continue ruin your marriage in a manipulative, underhanded manner**. You CANNOT trust with the details of your relationship, or be around your husband. IMO, the right thing do here is YOU message say, We [you & husband] need some process this. Were not can ever being with you [her husband] the way before. Please respect wishes refrain from contacting are ready. Then block everywhere (EVERYWHERE. FB, email, phone, snapchat, etc) give you your work on your marriage WITHOUT HER INTERFERENCE. This should be the #1 priority you. This is the ONLY WAY de-escalate the situation.
