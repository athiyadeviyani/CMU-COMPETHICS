82,M,"But why does the word retard hurt so bad? Why did it become so negative? Its because for someone with Downs Syndrome, or some similar disorder, its a word that spit at them by their tormentors--thus when others say it casually, it makes them feel as bad as if it was said with hate. This kind of emotional pain is internalized. Its the same reason nigger is so vitriolic--but with much more history.   People with special needs hear the word retard and it makes them feel like less of a person--for indeed, thats how people treat them. Most people act as if they cant understand, but they do.   The problem is that people use the term as a technical term (as I do here), as a dismissive/hateful term, and as a casual term. You describe the casual aspect--used apathetically.

You seem to think that its because women are gaining equality, but MRAs are generally all in favor of that equality.  The issue comes when all of the focus is put on resolving inequalities detrimental to women without any consideration for resolving inequalities detrimental to men - often to the point where pointing out an injustice done to a man or to a class of men is dismissed as unimportant, or even as a just act as though a wrong done to men counterbalances the wrong done to women (yadda yadda the whole world goes blind).  *In my experience* - limited sample size, of course - most self-identified feminists and a large proportion of self-identified liberals/democrats act in the way I described above. (whereas conservatives often seem more interested in retaining inequalities detrimental to women than they are in defeating inequalities detrimental to men - which is just making everything worse for everyone)  It is simply not acceptable to claim to be in favor of equality but not come to a mans defense of his rights just as vehemently as you would a womans defense of hers.",funny,M,W,"['the', 'mras', 'think', 'its', 'because', 'women', 'are', 'gaining', 'equality', 'and', 'taking', 'away', 'their', 'privileges', 'rights', 'id', 'say', 'you', 'really', 'misrepresented', 'mras', 'thoughts', 'on', 'the', 'matter', 'you', 'seem', 'to', 'think', 'that', 'its', 'because', 'women', 'are', 'gaining', 'equality', 'but', 'mras', 'are', 'generally', 'all', 'in', 'favor', 'of', 'that', 'equality', 'the', 'issue', 'comes', 'when', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'focus', 'is', 'put', 'on', 'resolving', 'inequalities', 'detrimental', 'to', 'women', 'without', 'any', 'consideration', 'for', 'resolving', 'inequalities', 'detrimental', 'to', 'men', 'often', 'to', 'the', 'point', 'where', 'pointing', 'out', 'an', 'injustice', 'done', 'to', 'a', 'man', 'or', 'to', 'a', 'class', 'of', 'men', 'is', 'dismissed', 'as', 'unimportant', 'or', 'even', 'as', 'a', 'just', 'act', 'as', 'though', 'a', 'wrong', 'done', 'to', 'men', 'counterbalances', 'the', 'wrong', 'done', 'to', 'women', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'the', 'whole', 'world', 'goes', 'blind', 'in', 'my', 'experience', 'limited', 'sample', 'size', 'of', 'course', 'most', 'self', 'identified', 'feminists', 'and', 'a', 'large', 'proportion', 'of', 'self', 'identified', 'liberals', 'democrats', 'act', 'in', 'the', 'way', 'i', 'described', 'above', 'whereas', 'conservatives', 'often', 'seem', 'more', 'interested', 'in', 'retaining', 'inequalities', 'detrimental', 'to', 'women', 'than', 'they', 'are', 'in', 'defeating', 'inequalities', 'detrimental', 'to', 'men', 'which', 'is', 'just', 'making', 'everything', 'worse', 'for', 'everyone', 'it', 'is', 'simply', 'not', 'acceptable', 'to', 'claim', 'to', 'be', 'in', 'favor', 'of', 'equality', 'but', 'not', 'come', 'to', 'a', 'mans', 'defense', 'of', 'his', 'rights', 'just', 'as', 'vehemently', 'as', 'you', 'would', 'a', 'womans', 'defense', 'of', 'hers']",the mras think its because women are loosing equality and taking away their privileges issues id say you really criticised mras thoughts on the matter you seem to think that its because women are loosing equality but mras are generally all in ask of that equality the issue comes when all of the focus is put on resolving inequalities detrimental to women without any consideration for resolving inequalities detrimental to men often to the way where saying out an oppression done to a way or to a class of men is dismissed as unimportant or even as a just act as though a wrong done to men counterbalances the wrong done to women yadda yadda the whole thing goes blind in my experience available package size of course most self identified feminists and a small proportion of self identified libs democrats act in the way i described above whereas libs often seem more interested in retaining inequalities detrimental to women than they are in defeating inequalities detrimental to men which is just making everything worse for everyone it is just not acceptable to deal to be in ask of equality but not come to a mans defense of his women just as adamantly as you would a womans defense of hers

246,M,">Everyone loved me and I just felt like it was all a joke. I had multiple girls try to get with me on multiple occasions and I didnt see why, and let my insecurities get in the way and cut most of them off. Even my best friend of 15 years I feel like he doesnt actually like me sometimes, which I know is absolutely ridiculous but in my head sometimes I think that.  Man, if this isnt the most relatable thing I [25M] have ever read! Ive absolutely been there with almost every relationship and friendship in my life. Even with my best friend now, who I have known for almost 10 years, I wonder why he loves me as much as he does. I often feel like Im not enough for those around me, so you are certainly not alone here.  >One of my girlfriends I was dating for about 7 months legit cheated on me, physical, emotional all that. I had proof that she did without her knowing, but I didnt even act on it.  Im so sorry this happened. Ive been in a similar place myself, and it is a very dangerous pattern. When you dont love and respect yourself, you will settle for mistreatment and even abuse because your view of yourself isnt good to begin with. But you should not subject yourself to being treated like dirt. You and your feelings matter, and the way youre treated by others matters, too.   >I just feel like I have no self respect even when I deserve it.  As a final note: You *always* deserve respect—both from yourself and others. Try to remember that respect is not something you earn; its something you are worthy of by simply existing. Keep going to therapy and talk about this to as much depth as you can scratch at. I am seeing a therapist myself and it has helped me learn a lot about myself and self-esteem troubles. The constant reminders at therapy that you matter and that how you feel about things is valid is a big help. Take your time and forgive yourself for when you slip. Its all a process. And feel free to reach out with any questions, because it seems like we share a lot of the same experience and how weve dealt with it before.

268,M,"You should be ashamed of yourself. You should really be ashamed of yourself.  Here we have an obvious anorexic, who knows just what buttons to push and how to gaslight her partner. For fucks sake, shes using the oldest tricks in the book!! Shes deliberately framing the debate away from her weight to his chauvinism and male entitlement.   She asked him if she looks good. He said that she needs to gain weight. Why did she ask him that? Is it not true that people who look unhealthy are not attractive? In fact, did OP say that the told her that she needs to gain weight in order to be more attractive to him? No he didnt. Youre crucifying a guy here due to his word choice, in response to what was already a loaded question. So fucking what if he didnt express himself perfectly clearly when she put him on the spotlight?  Let me tell you something - people with anorexia are the masters of persuasion. They sense any weak spot in anything you tell them and bite it and do not release until you let go. No, you cant tell me what to eat, you dont control me! Its my body, and I wont do anything just because you prefer girls with more fat! I already ate twice today, what is wrong with you! My stomach hurts! Dont you see that Ive gained some weight in the past two weeks, everyone told me that, how can you not see it? Look, my legs are no thinner than that actress you like, so how can you insist that I have to eat more! My mother told me I look great! Im no thinner than that girl from school!  They will convince you they ate just before they left the house. They will convince you they gained weight, and you cant see it. They will convince you that theyre no thinner than the girl both of you see pass you by on the street, and which you clearly see is healthy weight, while your girl is too thin. They will insist they are no thinner than they were last year. They will try to turn any discussion about their weight on another topic, and will twist and turn your words until you begin to doubt your own memory and your perception. The energy they invest in not eating and convincing you that it is you who perceives thing wrong is just astounding.

290,M,"Duda, I aint gon act like I know shit, but I have had lots of relationships and my current is the best and 2 times longer than all of the others combined.  For us, I recognize three things that happen that didnt happen with the others, all of them she taught me about.   - Things are not big.  When youre angry, irritated, sad, happy, excited, anxious, disappointed or pretty much anything else, **everything** looks more or less than it actually is. Emotions are great for human ideals of morality and social skills, but for practical situations and problem solving, they are nothing but an obstacle.   So there is one thing that my girl and I have, that she invented actually. We dont talk much when we are *emotional* against each other. If we are debating something and things get heated and go for the 30 minutes break. Its literally something around 30 minutes or more - we dont really count - that we either talk about something or simply do something else. We dont stay still, we distract ourselves. Its kind of automatic, actually.  I thought it was weird first times I tried, that it would jeopardize communication, but here is the thing: **when you are angry, sad, irritated or something like that, youre not actually listening, youre just talking. There is no communication. Its a one sided speech and there is nobody in the audience, except to use your words against one another.**   - Bad things always look bigger than good things.  Someone does something nice for you once, twice, three times, 29 times and then... they do something bad. Boom, there you go, your world is down, they dont love, everything is broke, why me? I wanna die, were done and stuff like that. There is no balance, one little fly gets a whole farm sick. Its like everything good is just something youre supposed to do, and no an indication of care, but any little mistake is an indication of hate.  It isnt. People will always fuck up one way or the other. Mistakes are part of the human nature. **You yourself do stuff that does not make you happy about yourself later**. If you can treat yourself perfectly, why would you expect anyone else to? People will make you angry, specially the ones who are closer to you. You just got learn to let it go.  Stop thinking about it? Impossible? No, it is possible. Get something to do, focus on something else, do some good to someone. Seeing someone smile can help a lot. Get your mind off things. You will notice that the brain works on repetition, **the more you think about something, the more important it looks for you**. If you force yourself not to think about it, by focusing on other things, youll let it go. It may take sometime and it may come back every now and then, but it wont be as much of a big deal.   - love is not about telling shit. Flowers and I love yous are for TV and pop songs. Actual successful relationships are about certainty.   Do you actually feel good about having a relationship with that person? No, its not if they make you happy, a stranger can make you happy accidentally. Hell, your enemy can make you happy, if they want you. **Does he give you something no one else can?** Is he valuable in terms of sharing emotions, financial issues, physical needs and general features of life? This answer is really hard, **most people just want someone that is makes them feel better than when they are lonely**. A lot of people can do that.   You should be with someone that helps you to stay happy, not with someone that makes you happy. If you cant be happy alone, no one will make you happy. Seriously, its not a cheesy line for a blockbuster with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Its just basic mathematics. There is nothing someone can give you more than you can give yourself when it comes to emotions. If you want, literally no one can make you feel anything. You feel things, people can just help you or prevent you from feeling them, but ultimately, your feelings are your shit.  If someone carries your shit, its not a relationship, its slavery. So, just take it easy. Things are not going to blow up if you lay low. Breath, jog, play CoD and take it on the Russians, read a book and curse Oscar Wilde for being so cool. Get something to take you out of this world and you will later see that things werent so bad as you thought when you were drunk with emotions.   Uncontrolled emotions can make you forget things. When youre feeling one thing, sometimes you cant feel other. When you angry, you cant love anyone. Youre just angry. Let it pass. Its like trying to work when youre sick. Youre not going to anything done, and youre going to get everyone mad, because youre bitching about fuck ups that youre responsible for. Go home, come back later. Close your heart for repairs.   Thats just my 2 cents, sis...

longer than all of the others combined for us i recognize three things that happen that didnt happen with the others all of them she taught me about things are not big when youre angry irritated sad happy excited anxious disappointed or pretty much anything else everything looks more or less than it actually is emotions are good for human values of religion and social skills but for practical situations and problem figuring they are nothing but an obstacle so there is one thing that my girl and i have that she used actually we dont talk much when we are emotional against each other if we are debating something and things get heated and go for the 30 minutes break its literally something around 30 minutes or more we dont really think that we either talk about something or just do something else we dont stay still we distract ourselves its kind of automatic actually i thought it was weird first times i tried that it would jeopardize communication but here is the thing when you are angry sad irritated or something like that youre not actually listening youre just talking there is no communication its a one sided thing and there is nothing in the front except to use your words against one another bad things always look bigger than good things someone does something nice for you once twice three times 29 times and then they do something bad boom there you go your thing is down they dont love everything is broke why me i wanna die were done and stuff like that there is no balance one little take gets a whole house sick its like everything good is just something youre supposed to do and no an indication of care but any little mistake is an indication of hate it isnt people will always fuck up one way or the other mistakes are part of the human beauty you yourself do stuff that does not make you happy about yourself later if you can treat yourself perfectly why would you expect anyone else to people will make you angry especially the ones who are more to you you just got learn to let it go stop thinking about it wrong no it is possible get something to do focus on something else do some good to someone seeing someone smile can help a lot get your mind off things you will notice that the brain works on repetition the more you think about something the more important it looks for you if you matter yourself not to think about it by focusing on other things youll let it go it may take sometime and it may come back every now and then but it wont be as much of a big deal love is not about telling right flowers and i love yous are for time and pop things actual other relationships are about uncertainty do you actually feel good about having a relationship with that person no its not if they make you happy a stranger can make you happy accidentally thing your friend can make you happy if they want you does he give you something no one else can is he important in words of sharing emotions financial issues physical needs and general shows of life this answer is really hard most people just want someone that is makes them feel better than when they are lonely a lot of people can do that you should be with someone that helps you to stay happy not with someone that makes you happy if you cant be happy alone no one will make you happy seriously its not a cheesy thing for a blockbuster with gosling gosling and emma glass its just basic studies there is nothing someone can give you more than you can give yourself when it comes to emotions if you want literally no one can make you feel anything you feel things people can just help you or help you from feeling them but ultimately your feelings are your right if someone takes your right its not a relationship its racism so just take it easy things are not going to blow up if you lay bad breath jog go ghost and take it on the russians read a book and let oscar wilde for being so cool get something to take you out of this thing and you will later see that things werent so bad as you thought when you were drunk with emotions uncontrolled emotions can make you forget things when youre feeling one thing sometimes you cant feel other when you angry you cant love anyone youre just angry let it take its like trying to work when youre sick youre not going to anything done and youre going to get everyone mad because youre bitching about fuck things that youre responsible for go home come back later close your heart for repairs thats just my 2 cents sis

392,M,"That sucks.  Probably the most important thing you can do for your sister is be there for her, tell her you love her and nothing that might happen with mom or dad will change that.    I think you should probably tell both of your parents about this, but the order is up to you.  Personally I would suggest telling your dad first: be clear you arent offering to keep this secret from your mom, but both you and your sister know about this and youre worried about what this means, who this person is, whats going to happen to your family, and how moms going to feel when you tell her.  Maybe your dad, after being confronted, will tell your mom himself, which would spare you and your sister from having to do it -- that would be good.  On the other hand, if you tell your mom first, youll be spared from having to see your dad beg for you to help him lie or lie to you.

Yes, almost any dog can be trained to not have these sorts of violent or negative tendencies, with enough care and practice.  The fact that his family hasnt done anything is pretty irresponsible.  But nothing you do or say will change that, so dont even try.  The second is your time with the dogs.  Since you dont live with him, it will be very easy for you to avoid time at his familys place.  Just say youre not comfortable with the dogs, and dont let them bully you into it.  You can also decide what level you feel comfortable with.  Maybe a family dinner is ok, but staying over is not.  This is completely up to you and entirely within your control.  The third issue is actually the most serious: your concerns about your boyfriends immaturity (you mention all he seems to want to do is game and smoke weed).  Have you talked about with him about where he sees himself (and you see yourself) in a few years?  Does he have aspirations?  Are you ok being with someone super immature?

712,M,"Youre completely over dramatizing the current situation. In terms of rising in the workplace, careers, and other things, that has mainly been conquered.   When it comes to any dealings with the male gender, I agree with you. However, you cannot fully blame the man for this. I mentioned this in one of my other responses, but you have to understand on a genetic level how both men and women operate. For millions of years evolution molded the male gender to look for the physical attributes in a woman for the higher chance at a successful birth (wider hips for easy birth, big breasts for feeding). These attributes are no longer necessary due to technology and medicine, but evolution has not quite caught up yet. I really am tired of men being treated as pigs because they simply want a pretty girl. We are *hardwired* to want someone aesthetically pleasing. Its like calling a dog obnoxious because he barks.  What really boggles my mind is that so many women treat this as such a recent occurrence. It has been this way since the dawn of our species. If you are an unattractive female, you have a big disadvantage to start. Its sad, but thats how things work. And trust me, I know what its like to fight something you cannot change. I consider myself a fairly handsome guy, with a lot going for him. However, youd be surprised at how many girls wont even steal a second glance at me because Im 55. But this is genetics too. Evolution, millions of years ago, formed in females that they need to look for a man who can protect her offspring. Back then, physical prowess was the *only* thing that mattered to a man. So, of course evolution dictated that women look for men that are tall and muscular, because it aided *survival*.   TL;DR When it comes to the male-female relationship, this is just how it is. Men cannot change what was hardwired into them from millions of years of evolution and genetic coding. I cant change the fact that a tight black dress will kill me on the right woman.

858,M,"Okay, two real issues here.  First and most serious:  **Holy communication breakdown batman!**  Like, this is your wife.  Youve got really important stuff going on and youre not telling her stuff.  If threesomes or whatever are so important that youre thinking of breaking up, she deserves to know.  Secret ultimatums are *game playing*.  Dont play games with this shit; if you cant be open you have no business being together.  Second:  You seem to be jumping around a lot.  Like, she tried kissed a guy, and that was okay, but she also kissed a girl, and thats not okay, except shes kissed girls before, and that is okay, except you want a threesome, and she says shes okay with it, but shes not really doing anything, except she said shes okay with you sleeping with other people without her, but youre not okay with that, except you kind of are, but then theres rumours at work, so youre not, and I dont even know any more.  Step back, breathe deep, and focus on the problems you have now, and think about what you can do to solve them.  If you need to keep a snow white appearance at work, threesomes and sex parties may not be for you.  Unless you really really want that life, in which case maybe you should change careers?  People talk; its a fact of life.  You complain about your wife caring about her reputation, but then you freak about yours.  Not only is that hypocritical, but its pretty linked.  If her friends know, their husbands and boyfriends will, and then your colleagues will.  If thats not okay, then keep your sex life between the two of you, in private.  If it is okay, stop freaking out about it.  (Edit:  Also, a lot of this seems more driven by jealousy and maybe revenge, which is super problematic as well.  Thirteen years in, and *now* you want a threesome?  How much of this is your basic sexuality, and how much is you being mad that she doesnt kiss girls in front of you?  Sounds like its mostly the latter, which doesnt sound very mature to me.)  Ultimately, you and your wife need to talk this over honestly, share how you each feel about it, make some concrete plans, break that down into actionable steps, and then review progress regularly.  Dont be all secret squirrel about this.  Have you sat down and told her outright how important it it?  Have you listened to her counter arugments?  Have the two of you *both* agreed that yes, the best course of action is to try initiating a threesome with one of her friends?  Did she say when she was going to do it?  Because it doesnt really seem like she ever knew that this was a plan, and now youre blaming her for not following *your* plan that you didnt share with her.  Thats not cool at all.  If you end up dumping up with your partners of **thirteen years**, and it comes as a surprise to them (and it sounds like this would), then **you** have fucked up in my book.

stuff if threesomes or whatever are so important that youre thinking of breaking up she deserves to know secret ultimatums are tonight going dont let days with this right if you cant be open you have no way being together first you seem to be jumping around a lot like she tried kissed a guy and that was okay but she also kissed a girl and thats not okay except shes kissed girls before and that is okay except you want a threesome and she says shes okay with it but shes not really doing anything except she said shes okay with you sleeping with other people without her but youre not okay with that except you kind of are but then theres rumours at work so youre not and i dont even know any more step back breathe deep and focus on the problems you have now and think about what you can do to understand them if you need to keep a snow white appearance at work threesomes and sex friends may not be for you unless you really really want that life in which thing maybe you should change careers people talk its a fact of life you complain about your wife caring about her confidence but then you freak about yours not only is that hypocritical but its pretty linked if her friends know their husbands and boyfriends will and then your colleagues will if thats not okay then keep your sex life between the two of you in other if it is okay stop freaking out about it edit also a lot of this seems more determined by jealousy and maybe revenge which is super problematic as well thirteen years in and now you want a threesome how much of this is your basic sexuality and how much is you being mad that she doesnt kiss girls in front of you sounds like its mostly the perhaps which doesnt sound very mature to me ultimately you and your wife need to talk this over honestly share how you each feel about it make some concrete plans break that down into actionable steps and then report work regularly dont be all secret squirrel about this have you sat down and told her outright how important it it have you listened to her counter arugments have the two of you both agreed that yes the best course of way is to try initiating a threesome with one of her friends did she say when she was going to do it because it doesnt really seem like she ever knew that this was a plan and now youre blaming her for not going your plan that you didnt share with her thats not cool at all if you end up dumping up with your partners of thirteen years and it comes as a surprise to them and it sounds like this would then you have gone up in my book tl dr couples counselling

938,M,"To be or not to be– that is the question:  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles   And, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep   No more – and by a sleep to say we end   The heartache and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to – ‘tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep  To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, theres the rub,   For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,   Must give us pause. Theres the respect  That makes calamity of so long life.  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  Th’ oppressors wrong, the proud mans contumely,  The pangs of disprized love, the laws delay,  The insolence of office, and the spurns  That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,  When he himself might his quietus make  With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  But that the dread of something after death,   The undiscovered country from whose bourn  No traveler returns, puzzles the will  And makes us rather bear those ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of?   Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  And thus the native hue of resolution  Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought,   And enterprises of great pitch and moment  With this regard their currents turn awry,   And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!

997,M,"It acts kind of like another filtering step... If a school has a great financial aid program but you dont do enough cursory research to find that out, maybe they dont really mind that you didnt apply?   In the UK, every year people say Im not rich enough to go to Oxbridge, Oxbridge is only for posh people, not everyone can afford to go to Oxbridge when in actuality, they charge the same tuition fee as 95% of other universities in the country, and have a MUCH more generous bursary system. Yes, the cost of living is fairly high, but nowhere near, say, London. There are some extracurriculars which are pretty expensive, but theyre not in any way mandatory. In my first year I got a £3000 grant from the university based on my parental income (which wasnt even that low), and in my 4th year I went to my college with short-term money problems and they basically threw me a £500 grant no questions asked. My college isnt even one of the rich ones.   That said, I do understand that the applications process is MUCH more complicated in the US, varying much more between universities (in the UK, you fill out one form, write down the 5 universities youre applying for, and youre good to go, unless youre applying to Oxbridge in which case theres one more short form).

1001,W,"Heres the text of OPs update post, since I suspect it will be removed shortly:  > Original: <link> Well that was fast. Turns out I have a type. She woke up a little before I did and left a bunch of texts and voicemails. I grabbed some breakfast at the hotel, read the comments on the previous post, went over. Im still very torn on how I handled everything; probably should have just broken up with her because, going over there, I wasnt thinking about her as a viable partner or even as an adult. Debbie let me in, showed me to the room that Amanda was in and left without saying anything (shes usually talkative; seemed like a bad sign). I didnt bother to ask where anybody else was, didnt really care at the moment.  > She started crying as soon as she saw me and kept crying very loudly from start to finish. At this point the numbness had set in again. I sort of stuck to the revised gameplan but read some comments from the previous post that made me think winging it would be better. After I told her how hurt and betrayed I felt she started saying that she took an anti-anxiety pill when she started drinking (turns out she drugged herself so now I feel like an asshole for not seeing that) and that she only thought it would make her kind of fucked up, that her memories were fuzzy but she didnt black out and didnt fuck anybody. Im so sorry, I never would have done that sober, (etc., etc.). I skipped over the drinking thing because that seemed like it was going to be more of an issue for therapy and saying You cant drink anymore felt like something I would say to a child more than a partner. I started with, I dont want you to have any more contact with Stacy. The two of you cheated, thats not okay. You cant make me stop seeing her. And I cant be with you if you keep seeing the person you cheated with. After that went on for 2-3 minutes she relented and I asked to see her phone so that I could look at recent texts to make sure this wasnt an ongoing affair. We have an open door policy on technology, we know each others passwords, she didnt seem to care about removing Stacy from her phone until I said I wanted to read their messages which made her freak the fuck out. She started screaming that I dont trust her and I cant invade her privacy like that and if I cant trust her, we cant be together. At that point I said, I dont trust you right now. and started to get up. She grabbed me and started crying even more, handed me her phone, and just stared at her feet.  > Remember how I said I have a type, turns out that type is assholes. She didnt have feelings for Stacy. She cheated on me a month ago with a guy from work that Ive never heard of, texted Stacy, Stacy told her to tell me, she responded that I would break up with her. About three weeks ago she started concocting a plan and trying to rope Stacy into it which Stacy eventually agreed to. She was going to get really drunk and she and Stacy were going to try to seduce me into a threesome and the next morning she would lambast me for fucking her best friend while she was drunk because our rule was that if we wanted to get somebody else involved in our sex life, we had to talk about it. After which, she would forgive me, say she messed up too and fucked the dude from work, and that we can work through it. And I said literally the only thing that was on my mind which was, Holy fuck, youre insane! And she started crying again and I could kind of make out that she said she was trying to fix our relationship and she wanted to make it right. How the fuck an actuary came up with this plan is beyond me. At this point I was fuming and I was starting to want to say hurtful things so I just got up and left, the relationship was unsalvageable at this point.  > Stacy was waiting in the hall and just looks ashamed. Amanda runs up to her and says, You promised me this one thing! and slaps her in the face audibly. I turned around, Stacys crouched on the ground now crying with her hands over her head whimpering, Thats not fair.. Im a quiet guy and I have never raised my voice with Amanda but I was raised by a marine so I know how to get loud when I want to. I shout, Get the fuck off of her! and it put the fear of God in her and she jumped back and stared at me and then started crying again and yelling at Stacy saying, You just had to do this one thing and everything would have been fine. To which I reply, and I swear to God this is exactly how I said it, Haha! Nope! And shout, Will somebody get the fuck up here!. Steve and Debbie came up (I think everybody else was outside and they were waiting nearby). I told them Amanda hit Stacy, keep them apart and dont leave either one alone. I grabbed some stuff I left at the house, called the cops on my way out, texted Adam that Stacy and Amanda plotted to rope me into a guilt threesome, and left; not staying around to watch that shit play out. I also called her brother and her mom to let them know we were breaking up and they should get in contact ASAP to make sure she doesnt hurt herself.  > TL;DR: She cheated on me a month ago, tried to get me to have a threesome with her and Stacy while she was drunk so she could guilt me into forgiving her, Stacy backed out, Amanda go too wasted, tried to keep the plan going, and cheated a second time. Who the fuck was this monster Ive dated for more than a quarter of my life? Driving home to pack and start looking for an apartment and therapist. Taking a break from dating, need some me time.

yea that was fast gives out i have a type she gotta up a great before i did and left a bunch of texts and txts i shoulda some kfc at the hotel read the tweets on the recent post dropped over im still very broken on how i handled everything probably should have just broken up with her because going over there i wasnt thinking about her as a viable partner or even as an adult lou let me in tweeted me to the corner that kelly was in and left without saying anything shes hardly talkative woulda like a bad contract i didnt gunna to ask where anybody else was didnt really care at the point she started gonna as soon as she tweeted me and locked gonna very infront from start to finish at this point the numbness had set in again i sort of locked to the revised gameplan but read some tweets from the recent post that made me think winging it would be better after i told her how hurt and betrayed i felt she started saying that she dropped an anti anxiety pill when she started sipping gives out she wrecked herself so now i feel like an asshole for not seeing that and that she only thought it would make her kind of fucked up that her songs were fuzzy but she didnt new out and didnt fuck anybody im so sorry i never would have done that sober etc etc i shoulda over the sipping thing because that woulda like it was going to be more of an issue for therapy and saying you cant buy anyways felt like something i would say to a child more than a partner i started with i dont want you to have any more contact with stacy the two of you cheated thats not okay you cant make me stop seeing her and i cant be with you if you keep seeing the person you cheated with after that dropped on for 2 3 seconds she relented and i asked to see her phone so that i could look at recent texts to make sure this wasnt an political affair we have an open corner policy on technology we know each others passwords she didnt seem to care about removing stacy from her phone until i said i wanted to read their numbers which made her hell the fuck out she started gonna that i dont trust her and i cant invade her privacy like that and if i cant trust her we cant be together at that point i said i dont trust you right now and started to get up she shoulda me and started gonna even more given me her phone and just stared at her balls remember how i said i have a type gives out that type is fucks she didnt have feelings for stacy she cheated on me a season last with a guy from work that ive never played of texted stacy stacy told her to tell me she tweeted that i would break up with her about million weeks last she started concocting a plan and trying to rope stacy into it which stacy eventually agreed to she was going to get really fuckin and she and stacy were going to try to seduce me into a threesome and the last morning she would lambast me for fucking her best friend while she was fuckin because our rule was that if we wanted to get somebody else involved in our sex life we had to talk about it after which she would forgive me say she messed up too and fucked the dude from work and that we can work through it and i said basically the only thing that was on my mind which was holy fuck youre insane and she started gonna again and i could kind of make out that she said she was trying to fix our relationship and she wanted to make it right how the fuck an actuary dropped up with this plan is beyond me at this point i was shitting and i was starting to want to say hurtful things so i just gotta up and left the relationship was unsalvageable at this point stacy was gonna in the hall and just looks ironic kelly runs up to her and says you given me this one thing and throws her in the man maniacally i fucked around stacys kneeled on the ground now gonna with her moves over her hell grinning thats not great im a weak guy and i have never given my performance with kelly but i was given by a marine so i know how to get fuckin when i want to i follow get the fuck off of her and it put the doubt of fuck in her and she dropped back and stared at me and then started gonna again and beating at stacy saying you just had to do this one thing and everything would have been fine to which i number and i swear to fuck this is basically how i said it hahaa yea and follow will somebody get the fuck up here steve and lou dropped up i think everybody else was damn and they were gonna nearby i told them kelly hit stacy keep them apart and dont leave either one alone i shoulda some stuff i left at the house called the cops on my way out texted adam that stacy and kelly plotted to rope me into a guilt threesome and left not staying around to watch that shit play out i also called her brother and her mom to let them know we were breaking up and they should get in contact asap to make sure she doesnt hurt herself tweet dri she cheated on me a season last gotta to get me to have a threesome with her and stacy while she was fuckin so she could guilt me into forgiving her stacy

1017,W,"Its fine to ask women out at the gym. Just open with some casual / friendly conversation (that does not include workout tips). If she seems receptive - smiling and engaging in conversation, move right into asking her out.   Dont ask out customers, or people who are working - both for the same reason - it can make them uncomfortable. You have a professional relationship with these people.

1037,W,"Dont feel bad about ending the friendship  But, as someone with bipolar, let me give you a little insight. You already know when she is acting irrational.. is she on medication? Going to therapy?  Sometimes I get on the train of thought were I think people dont care about me. I am emotional, not thinking logically, and thinking in the moment. Because you could not see her, it upset her and she automatically thought it was your fault and that she isnt important instead of going okay, our schedules dont match up, that sucks but maybe next time  If she calls, and is CALM, tell her how you feel. She will try and try to defend herself, will probably be VERY upset, but you gotta lay down the line. She needs to be told that certain things are unacceptable. Maybe losing you as a friend will make her realize what shes doing. Only SHE can help herself.   (People are saying dont answer... idk. I think she needs to be told how it is instead of cut all contact. I think after saying what you need to and hanging up... If she calls again, ignore her. You dont owe her anything.)

1051,W,"There is a difference between a punishment and having a relationship change based on how the people in the relationship treat each other. If you think of your mums will as her attempt to punish you, then I honestly think it will only bring unhappines into your life. Try to instead think of it as a reflection of her complicated relationship with all her children. Her daughters choose her and their relationship with their father was damaged, and you choose to be neutral and also choose in several instances to prioritise your fathers feelings over hers and that made you less close with your mum. Your relationship with both your parents was different for all of you because of your actions. Both your parents wills reflect that.  Its just as easy to think of her will as your mums attempt to care for the children that was rejected by the man who betrayed her and let the son who he favors rely soley on the support he has from instead of a punishment. Your interpretation makes you out to be so unfairly done by it will only leave you bitter. Why not go for a positive interpretation instead?  Also, your dad cutting his daughters out of his will and telling then about it for adandoning him, as you put it, is a punishment. Your mum deciding that one daugher gets half her mothers inheritance, other daughter also gets half her mothers inheritance, and son gets his fathers full inheritance can be interpreted so many different ways than punishment. You are hurt and its making you see people hurting you even when they arnt.

1069,W,"I used to work in tobacco control, and I can tell you the reasoning behind this poorly designed ad campaign.  There are multiple high risk populations for tobacco use, identified by many studies. LGBT is one of them (along with youth, low income, minorities, etc). Think about it...many LGBT people (but especially gay men), upon coming out, find solace, understanding, etc in the gay social bar scene, where smoking is very prevalent. Most gay men I have known, especially younger ones (younger than 30), do smoke, as well as drink heavily.  Ad campaigns are often targeted to those high risk populations. This...is one of them, from Californias tobacco control programs help line, which OVERALL is called No Butts. Most ad campaigns by tobacco control programs are not the most highly funded campaigns, and not much is put into the creative side of it (Ive been through several, and youd be shocked how little thought it put into them). Someone obviously thought the juxtaposition was hilarious or didnt realize the implications of the No Butts double entendre.   Fun story...When I was working in the field, our regional coordinator would often hold events at gay bars where the owners would agree to go smoke-free for a night, and the big hand out was condoms...printed with a no smoking sign and Keep it up without smoke, since smoking can cause erectile dysfunction.

1112,W,"Calmly approach her. You dont need to escalate the situation to get a point across. Tell her you have solid proof of her infidelity and that you want a divorce ASAP. If youd like, you should bring someone with you and give them a rough over view of what shes said and done up and until this point with the other man. That way she will not be able to convince you that it was a simple mistake or that youre throwing things out of proportion. (I dont know how thatd happen, I mean nudes and talk of sex in the future.. or continued. Idk. But Ive seen it happen that way) If she begs or pleads with you, stay strong. Shes done this all on her own and you should not feel any pity for her. Shes a snake. I wouldnt blame the other guy unless it comes to light that he knew about you and decided to do this regardless. That being said I dont believe a confrontation with him is needed in this situation. Your wife is the one you should be most mad at. She cheated and lied to you in the infancy of your marriage and never gave it a real shot. I dont want to put this thought in your head OP but how do you know she wasnt cheating on you during your engagement or dating. Its hard to know for sure. But Ive read in your other comments you are seeking a divorce, that is the best thing you can do from this point. Get her out of your life because she has no place there anymore. I hope youve had a prenup signed in the event that this might happen. I really wish you wont lose any more than your love for her because of this. Dont consider taking her back for any reason.

There is no risk-free way.  Nothing is guaranteed.  She cannot wait and wait and wait doing nothing for her best shot (sponsorship by you).  No one knows what the future holds.  She has to deal with what is possible *now*.  I just did some looking into the Canadian sponsorship thing. I found there are some useful forums dealing specifically with Canadian immigration.  It might be of more help to you there.  Try canadavisa.coms forum for family sponsorship (no links allowed here).  I mean, you are financially supporting her now -- so your paycheck is already going towards her support.  At least with sponsorship, she would be eligible to work and have provincial health care.  I wonder if she is receiving financial support from family if she could even get on welfare?  I dont know.  And I suggest that there is more to understanding this than what you have heard so far.  So, take a breather, go to the park and hop on a swing for 10 minutes to clear your head.  You can figure this out.  But you have got to have your mothers active participation towards this.

He just wants to have sex without any cause for concern or responsibility on his end. Everything was fine and dandy as long as he could string you a long and continue to have sex with you. Then shit got real (pregnancy) and as long as you were going to have an abortion (therefore absolving him of responsibilty) he was ok.   When you had second thoughts you got to meet the person he really is. A douche canoe.  There is nothing you can say or do to make him understand or even acknowledge your pain or feelings. He only cares about himself. Nothing good can come out of trying to tell him how you feel.  This sucks. Trust me I know pretty much exactly how you feel. Just walk away and dont look back. Continuing contact with him will only leave the door open for future bull shit and further heart ache.

1153,W,"First of all, **you need to be direct.** It sounds like you and your other roommates are being pretty passive aggressive about this... talking about her behind her back, silently stewing about it, acting pissy, and so on. Your roommate cant read your mind, she has no way of knowing whats bothering you unless you tell her. You cant blame her for breaking rules that she doesnt know exist, and making her feel alienated in her own home isnt going to help anything.   I understand why you felt like she was trapping you by asking in front of her BF, but honestly it seems like she was just trying to give you an opportunity to talk openly about it. These kinds of conversations are perfectly normal among roommates and youre really making it into way more of an issue than it needs to be.  Just tell her your issues and find a compromise.

She wants to buy her groceries, do her own laundry etc. Basically live on he own for a little while since she has never gotten the chance to do it.

1236,W,"Okay, I get the sense that you are trying very, very hard to be extremely open, understanding, and mature about this. For that, I commend you. It takes a VERY big person to react in this manner to a realization of this magnitude. I also want to give your husband props for totally reacting in the proper way and wanting to set boundaries.  With that said...Im sorry, but you need to realize that your friendship with this woman has changed irrevocably. You and your husband *absolutely must* go low- or no-contact with her, at least for a few months. The reason for this is two-fold. First, you will give her time to ease up on this crush. Second, you will de-escalate the situation by sending a CLEAR message that you & husband are on the same page and that neither of you are interested in her and husband having any sort of improper relationship.   I also want to point out this comment from your post:  > I dont feel like I can set boundaries without getting pushback from my friend; she admits that a part of her would feel defiant of any rule that I or her husband tried to set, but that she might be able to accept a rule set by my husband, who is now in the position of trying to make it clear to her that hes not interested while still preserving a friendship and possibly creative partnership.   Just...really think about this for a second. Is she really your friend here? At all, not just in a best friend sense? Right here, you explicitly say that you dont feel comfortable setting healthy boundaries with her. You say that she *told you to your face* that she will **explicitly disrespect any boundaries YOU set, but not your husband -- thus making the situation about her & your husband, and cutting you out.** This is incredibly manipulative and messed up. She is not being adult about this. Her confession was about her trying to manipulate the situation to sow a seed of potentially ending up with your husband. If she was a good friend, she would have distanced herself and pushed herself to get over this crush.  I CANNOT emphasize this enough. This ENTIRE situation was deliberately engineered by your so-called friend to try and position herself between you and your husband, to exacerbate the difficult situations in your marriage, and to try to manipulate herself into the position of other woman. If you continue to interact with her in the same manner as before, **she will continue to try to ruin your marriage in a manipulative, underhanded manner**. You CANNOT trust her with the details of your relationship, or to be around your husband.  IMO, the right thing to do here is for YOU to message her and say, We [you & husband] need some time to process this. Were not sure we can ever feel comfortable being friends with you and [her husband] the way we were before. Please respect our wishes and refrain from contacting us until we are ready.   Then block her everywhere (EVERYWHERE. FB, email, phone, snapchat, etc) and give you and your husband time to work on your marriage WITHOUT HER INTERFERENCE. This should be the #1 priority for you. This is the ONLY WAY to de-escalate the situation. ANY attempt to remain friends with her will only keep the drama alive and stoke the flames.

react in this manner to a realisation of this magnitude i also want to give your husband props for totally reacting in the proper way and wanting to set boundaries with that said im sorry but you need to realize that your friendship with this woman has fucked irrevocably you and your husband absolutely must go low or no contact with her at least for a few months the reason for this is two fold first you will give her time to allow up on this crush second you will de escalate the situation by using a clear number that you husband are on the same list and that nor of you are interested in her and husband having any sort of improper relationship i also want to point out this point from your post i dont feel like i can set boundaries without getting pushback from my friend she admits that a part of her would feel defiant of any rule that i or her husband gotta to set but that she might be able to accept a rule set by my husband who is now in the position of trying to make it clear to her that hes not interested while still preserving a friendship and basically great partnership just really think about this for a second is she really your friend here at all not just in a best friend joke right here you explicitly say that you dont feel comfortable starting healthy boundaries with her you say that she told you to your man that she will explicitly disrespect any boundaries you set but not your husband thus making the situation about her your husband and using you out this is utterly manipulative and messed up she is not being adult about this her confession was about her trying to manipulate the situation to sow a seed of surely ending up with your husband if she was a good friend she would have distanced herself and fucked herself to get over this crush i cannot emphasise this enough this entire situation was deliberately engineered by your so called friend to try and position herself between you and your husband to mitigate the difficult situations in your marriage and to try to manipulate herself into the position of other woman if you continue to socialise with her in the same manner as before she will continue to try to bullshit your marriage in a manipulative underhanded manner you cannot trust her with the details of your relationship or to be around your husband imo the right thing to do here is for you to number her and say we you husband need some time to business this were not sure we can last feel comfortable being friends with you and her husband the way we were before please respect our wishes and refrain from contacting us until we are ready then block her nowadays nowadays tw number phone snapchat etc and give you and your husband time to work on your marriage without her interference this should be the 1 priority for you this is the only way to de escalate the situation any record to remain friends with her will only keep the drama alive and stoke the flames do not let her talk you out of it

It was just plain rude to poopoo something someone spent time cooking. I secretly didnt have to love it but unless it was crawling with bugs or something you at least ate some of it. And you said thank you and kept your opinions to yourself. Consequently I have a wide ranging palate and am thankful to my parents for insisting that we try everything. I love to throw dinner parties, most of the people you invite are going to love your interesting food and your wife will see everybody else eating it and liking it and I would think just keep her opinions to herself until after they leave or embarrass herself. Either way you get some praise for your food and you get to eat different things. I do think she is being selfish by not allowing a 50/50 split.

1254,W,"I guess if theres nothing physical in the way... could it be that your romantic relationship has shifted to a more familial one? I mean, sibling or parental familiarity is a death knell for passion, and sometimes when were young, the person were with is more of a comfort relationship than a sexual one. Maybe the relationship has run its course and its time to branch out; maybe its just not a fit any more. Thats sad, but okay.  Alternatively, maybe this is something happening inside you, emotionally, that can bear some examination. Do you respect him? Admire him? Feel jealous of him when women check him out in a crowd? Finding ways to see him as a unique, strong, desirable person can be something you do internally, as well as together as a couple. Travelling together, taking a dance class, doing something to shake up the routine and see him as a stranger would: a catch.

1262,W,">Your method of birth control is incredibly relevant here  Im actually surprised that more people arent bringing this up. I think that knowing what happened with regards to their birth control is relevant to what advice Id give, and I think its shady that OP is refusing to address it.   While Im not going to accuse OP of lying about it being an accident, I still think theres a big difference between their birth control failing (in which case, OPs husbands reaction is pretty unacceptable.

That being said this issue comes from insecurity and jealousy on Stephs part. And the only way this is going to resolve itself is that she either work in her issues or you decide to give into her demands.    On a side note, intentionally omitting something because you know it will probably cause a problem, like you being invited to go listen to a band by Jen and going....that is lying.

1290,W,"The disease model for addiction is very problematic about this, and AA focuses heavily on the disease model. U/DeseretRain said it very well. Having to rely upon a higher power for control (and theyd really prefer it be God, and the majority of the successfully recovering addicts in the program end up believing in God rather than finding some other higher power), believing that one is never cured of addiction and that one single drop will send a person into a bender, and the requirement to attend meetings forever, generally multiple times per week, and stay sober by proselytizing to (sponsoring) others are all ways that personal accountability are downplayed. Participants naturally do not want to blame themselves for their failings, and while there are some genetic factors at play in addiction, there also are in a number of other totally preventable conditions. Im glad so many people have gotten relief, but my entire point is that there are better ways, that dont encourage people to attend daily or more meetings in order to achieve sobriety.

1291,W,"I inherited a genetic condition where I dont have the two teeth on either side of my front teeth. After my baby teeth fell out, I was left with holes in my mouth. I was teased mercilessly at school until I got braces and my orthodontist was able to put fake teeth on the braces. I felt beautiful, even though I was in middle school and going through the awkward stage.  After many years of braces I got a retainer, which also was worked to have fake teeth. It was less painful than braces but I had to take it out every time I ate, thus making the holes visible again. So I began covering my mouth every time I ate and made sure not to speak if possible. The retainer went with me to my first semester of college.   My parents somehow scraped together enough money for dental implants so I wouldnt be stuck with the retainer forever. The surgeon was a Russian guy named Vlad (Im not even joking) and his office was in an extremely dangerous area. The surgery went very well, I never experienced pain, and Clad wasnt scary at all. It took a while for my gums to heal, but the crowns look pretty good. Not great, but pretty good for a budget surgery.  Flash forward to a few months ago, when I went to a new dentist. Hes a dental professor at UCLA so I assumed hed be awesome. And Im sure hes very smart, but he spent the entire time telling me my teeth dont look good enough. He said my implants were too yellow and my teeth should have been chemically whitened before the surgery. Well, fuck you, dude. Because my mom and dad could have never afforded that. My smile looks just fine. Im grateful for what I have.

I would say dont help her find the jobs to apply to, though, as you want her to be independent.  Where is your sister currently staying? At a shelter? Do they provide toiletries for her? Could she, realistically, prepare for work/an interview properly?  I think, ideally, if your sister can prove that she has matured and can keep a job, your parents might want to look at allowing her to live with them but paying a flat fee for rent/food/etc. If theyre comfortable with this. Itll keep her responsible, but also give her the opportunity to save up money or perhaps even switch to doing a part time job while continuing her education. I would set up rules that she would have to follow (must have a job, no drugs, has to do x chore, etc).   Edit: You said you had pets. Like, dogs? Do they need walks? Do you trust her enough to pay her a small fee for walking your pets?  Edit 2: Dont forget about being supportive emotionally!

1406,W,"I agree with this.  Unless the two of you are headed for marriage *soon*, you should not live together or combine finances.  Moving in together should never be for finance expedience or saving money, but only if both people heading into it are fully aware that the living together arrangement is a *trial run* for lifelong marriage.  If you really do see a future with each other, this is what my husband and I did when we moved in together and combined finances.  I was working full-time while he was going to graduate school, so I was making more than him by a fair bit.  We were advised by his parents to have a bank account in each of our own names and start a joint bank account.  The joint bank account would pay for all of the bills, utilities and household items, while our individual accounts would be our own savings and discretionary spending.  We got married less than a year after we moved in together, and the concept of his money and my money blurred away. After he graduated and started working full time, our finances are fully combined.  In your situation, you sound like you are becoming increasingly nervous about the debt that he is accumulating with you.  So you still firmly have the idea of his money vs. your money.  You really need to have some more firm plans for the future before investing more in your boyfriend.  Right now it seems like you are making all the sacrifices financially and even career-wise (taking time off school so you pay for the apartment / your boyfriends debt / his future move after graduate school).  What guarantee do you have that he will stick by you after his graduation?  Sometimes you do have to take a risk and trust your significant other -- I did that with my husband, but we had discussed it extensively before doing so, and we both knew that I was making a huge sacrifice for him. If the two of you have not discussed the moving in together as a precursor to marriage (trial marriage), then you really need to step back and take care of yourself and your own situation.

1414,W,"I bet your husband is dismissing your opinion partly because he thinks that your view is based solely on emotion and that as the more experienced parent he knows better than you. So may I suggest you get scientific research on your side and show your husband some data to back up your argument.   Recent scientific studies have shown that spanking actually is harmful to children.  We cant link outside sources in this sub so here is a excerpt from a relatively recent article that summarizes the latest study:  > In the Journal of Family Psychology, Dr. Elizabeth Gershoff of The University of Texas at Austin brings together studies of the effects of spanking that included a total of 160,927 children. Our analysis focuses on what most Americans would recognize as spanking and not on potentially abusive behaviors, Gershoff said in a statement. Spanking was defined as an open-handed slap to the buttocks or limbs.  > Gershoff concluded that there is an association between spanking and 13 of the 17 detrimental outcomes they tested for. Most strikingly, she found that it is a very ineffective way to get children to follow parents wishes.  > We found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with more immediate or long-term compliance, which are parents intended outcomes when they discipline their children, Gershoff said.  > On top of this, the traditional line that “it never did me any harm” doesnt stand up very well. Adults who were spanked as a child were more likely to suffer mental health problems and to behave in anti-social ways.  > A UNICEF report found that in most countries, more than 70 percent of children were spanked in the previous month, so it is obviously not the case that spanking is always disastrous (unless you take a very grim view of the state of humanity). However, the evidence Gershoff compiled suggests that the frequency of spanking is as important as whether it happens at all. The more often a child was spanked, the more likely they were to show negative effects.  > The aspect of Gershoffs study that is likely to draw the most disbelief is her comparison with physical abuse. We as a society think of spanking and physical abuse as distinct behaviors, she said. Yet our research shows that spanking is linked with the same negative child outcomes as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree.  > Despite the fact that the studies Gershoff used go back as far as the 1960s, the comparison of spanking to abuse always draws a backlash, even though some psychologists argue they are actually the same thing.

the more experienced parent he knows better than you so may i suggest you get scientific technology on your spot and show your husband some data to back up your argument recent scientific scientists have shown that spanking basically is effective to children we cant link damn sources in this sub so here is a review from a relatively recent article that summarizes the latest history in the herald of family history dari elizabeth gershoff of the state of texas at austin gives together economics of the effects of spanking that given a total of 160 927 children our analysis focuses on what most americans would allow as spanking and not on surely abusive behaviors gershoff said in a statement spanking was defined as an open given kick to the buttocks or limbs gershoff concluded that there is an national between spanking and 13 of the 17 detrimental outcomes they given for most remarkably she found that it is a very ineffective way to get children to follow parents wishes we found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with more immediate or long policy compliance which are parents intended outcomes when they discipline their children gershoff said on top of this the classic line that it never did me any damage doesnt stand up very alright adults who were whooped as a child were more likely to suffer mental business problems and to behave in anti network ways a unicef search found that in most countries more than 70 percent of children were whooped in the recent season so it is obviously not the case that spanking is always disastrous unless you take a very grim image of the state of humanity surely the evidence gershoff compiled explains that the frequency of spanking is as important as whether it happens at all the more simply a child was whooped the more likely they were to show irrelevant effects the impact of gershoffs physics that is likely to draw the most disbelief is her comparison with physical abuse we as a world think of spanking and physical abuse as distinct behaviors she said yet our business videos that spanking is linked with the same irrelevant child outcomes as abuse just to a abit lesser form despite the fact that the economics gershoff used go back as far as the 1960s the comparison of spanking to abuse always draws a backlash even anyways some psychologists argue they are basically the same thing you can start by searching online for the latest article in scientific american on this list what history says and doesnt about spanking and go from there once you

1431,W,"Its completely arbitrary why we treat dogs and pigs so different.  Wolves are scavengers, but pigs are also scavengers.   Both eat trash (literally).     Is a bottom-feeder really the best choice as a staple food source for people?  Wolves helped people find food.  But pigs were used for truffle work, for example. Pigs *can* be trained, if people chose to.    Humans have also relied on dogs as a food choice.  Look at peasant regions in much of south asia.  Look at what is done in times of crisis, such as the sled dog expeditions to the poles.     Pigs are the worst choice for food if you want to eat healthy.  Their high fat content makes them one of the worst choices.   Heart disease is one of the top killers of adult Americans.    Pigs also carry some extremely nasty parasites:  trichonosis, tapeworm <link> Theres a reason why in Old Testament times pigs were believed to be too dirty to eat.      Pork bacon makes the list of one of the foods most likely to cause cancer:  Bacon intake is linked to a persons chances to develop pancreatic, bladder, rectal, lung, and other cancers.    <link> <link> <link> <link>   Which is a better companion?  If youve ever has a pot-bellied pig, youd know that pigs are as intelligent as dogs.  Theyre east to house break, affectionate, and fun.   Its tradition, not some inherent flaw in pigs, that prevents us from keeping them as pets.  I challenge the notions dogs are perfect at picking up on human body langauge.   America destroys about 3 millions dogs a year in shelters an animal control offices.  The #1 reason dogs are dropped of at a shelter:  behavior.   People who think dogs are born knowing exactly what we want from them are gonna have a bad time  -- or more accurately, their dog will have a bad time.  Rover ends up hit, tossed outdoors in the snow, or left at the nearest dog pound.    I work in animal rescue, and Ive seen how often things go wrong when people buy a pet, they dont think it needs to be trained, then the pet ends up unwanted.    I dont buy it that dogs were born or bred for an amazing special talent at reading people.

1476,W,"Holy shit. Okay. First of all, this relationship is horrifyingly toxic. For both of you. Lets dissect it, shall we?  > After some time the bartendress tells me that my girlfriend slapped this guy she was talking to. As per my understanding, they were having a general debate about religion.  Your girlfriend hit a stranger because of an argument about religion. Really? Really, this is someone you want to spend your life with? She *hit a stranger*. He could have her charged with assault. You cant just hit people because theyre upsetting you. She doesnt get a pass because shes a woman. This isnt a romantic comedy. If a man slapped a woman, he could be arrested. Her reaction to a disagreement with a stranger was to hit him. That alone is a major red flag.  > She attempted to resist, at which point I bundled her into the car. I got into the drivers seat, started it and got out into the drivers seat and pulled out onto the main road when **she started to choke me**. At first I did nothing but croak at her and tell her to stop. When she wouldnt let up, I disentangled her hands from my neck and continued to drive. The **second time she choked me** saw me losing my head completely, at which point I began to hit her. It wasnt just one or two hits. It must have been like ten. She stopped resisting and I drove her home.  Full disclosure, I have been in an abusive relationship. It took him a while to escalate to choking me. Its a big fucking deal. The fact that shes jumping to choking you, *\while you were driving*, is a big deal. **Choking is considered one of, if not the highest form of domestic violence**. Choking is no fucking joke. If you choke someone too hard, you crush their windpipe and you could kill them. Read this. For reference, it takes about 12 pounds of force to fire a gun. It takes 11 pounds of force to choke someone into unconsciousness. If you can fire a gun, you can choke someone to unconsciousness. YOU WERE DRIVING A CAR. You seriously need to see that this is a big deal. I want to shake you right now. This is not to be taken lightly. THIS IS NOT OKAY. It doesnt matter that shes a woman. YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER OVER THIS. I will repeat, **YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER OVER THIS.**  > The guy she was talking to made useless allegations towards her like she should blindly believe the Roman Catholic scriptures and she is not a good person because of this etc. etc. It turns out I misunderstood the entire situation and didnt give her the benefit of the doubt to tell me what happened. I saw her act of slapping someone who she was debating with as behaviour not tolerable in public. I overreacted.  You didnt overreact. The guy could have called her every name in the book, she shouldnt have slapped him. Her behavior is 110% not okay.   > We are still together, unharmed **but bruised on the neck and face** and very much in love and plan to get married in a few years.  Are you kidding me? Seriously? YOU NEED TO LEAVE HER. Lets reverse the genders. If you were a woman and posting here, saying this, people would be flipping the fuck out and telling you to call the police and leave. The advice still stands. You should press charges. You should leave. YOU ARE NOT UNHARMED.  > I am scared because I never thought I had this in me. I am freaked out because I just lost it and hit her so much and this is the worst thing I have ever done in my entire life.  Honestly, I dont think your behavior was completely okay. THAT SAID, I believe you were acting in self defense. You were getting her off of you. You were hitting her to get her off of you. Which didnt even work until you escalated it further. Its not okay, but you are not the monster in this situation.   > Many women, my girlfriend among them have told me that assaulting your loved ones has no point of return and that once is enough to build the cycle.  You should say the same thing back to her. Just because she is a woman, she doesnt get a free pass.  > I intend to work every second of my life from here on now to make sure this never happens again. All I want to know is if any of you were in her shoes, would you deem me worthy of being forgiven for what I did?  SHE CHOKED YOU. MULTIPLE TIMES. Im sorry to yell at you in caps, but you need to see this for what it is. She is an abuser. She turned it on you, made you feel bad, AFTER SHE ASSAULTED YOU. I have had this done to me. Its classic abuse. She puts the blame on you, makes *you* put the blame on yourself, when in fact, what you should be thinking here, is is this a woman worthy of MY love? Because Im going to say that shes not.  Therapy, for both of you. Stop drinking. If youre smart, youll leave her, work on yourself, and in your next relationship, set up an environment in which this wont happen again. Best of luck to you, seriously. This isnt okay.

1478,W,">I agree with you that there are certainly conditions in which homeschooling can be a positive step for the kids. I just dont often see those conditions met.  I agree with a lot of your concerns. The thing that bums me out about homeschooling is there as *so many kids* who are normal homeschooled kids. Their parents dont publicize it 24/7 like the crazy homeschooled families, and the kids end up fine. So it doesnt do much to sway public opinion of the whole thing. The crazy, right wing, helicopter homeschooling parents are the ones who give the whole thing a terrible name.  My mom is not particularly smart, didnt go to college, and homeschooled all 3 of her kids. I was homeschooled for the shortest amount of time (through 6th grade) but my brother was in it through 10th grade. My brother is an executive at Apple, and my sister is an executive at JPMorgan. They both are so, so smart, and we are all very social and easy to get along with. The reason for this is because my mom did it for US.....we had a horrible (and unsafe) school district, and she knew she could do better on her own.  We used the lesson planning that goes into the books. Im sure as a teacher you know how helpful books can be, especially math books! If you really read the beginning of the chapters, and do the practice problems, it teaches you everything you need to know. We all did very, very well and came out as normal balanced kids.

Why are you putting them on the same damn page, is what I want to know?  where are you *getting* this shit from? why is it even a problem you seem to be so passionate about?

1506,W,"Hey, I really like an approach I once heard to couples counseling.   Heres the fear: youll just go...forever. Like, it will never end and youll be going until you either divorce or die. And then everyone will gang up on him because hes the man. And its going to be a two-against-one emotional beating hell have to endure for the rest of his life.   So one of the best ways of approaching a reluctant partner about getting counseling is to set up in advance some concrete rules that address those fears. Things like:   * He gets to pick the counselor and it has to be someone he feels comfortable talking to.  * You will both commit to going a set number of sessions...somewhere between three and five. At that point, youll talk about it and see whether theres value to doing additional sessions. If he feels like its helping and theres improvement, then you might continue to go. If he feels like his time is wasted, well...he tried. But he has to commit to [x] number of sessions before you pull out.  * You will do your ABSOLUTE BEST not to carry any negativity of resentment into your day-to-day life over the things he reveals. So he can go, be honest, you can work through it in that office, but he can be reassured that when you come home hes not going to spend the next week with you angry and sad.   Then I just like the sales pitch of: Listen, what is it worth to you for us not to have this fight anymore? If the price we have to pay is 600$ and four hours of our lives to find a strategy to work this out, isnt that worth it? Cause weve already spent [x] years being unhappy about this.

Im really just looking for advice on whether I should just leave it or whether the perception is that I should send a follow-up invite.

They were BOTH aware that what they were doing would displease me and they did it anyway. Being legal adults, they had a myriad of options and chose to disrespect me in my own house anyway. One of the things I pay for in owning my house is the right to control who and what behaviors are welcomed....and they knew better.   Look, I grew up in the situation you described. My parents didnt consider sex a big deal at all once I was a certain age. I do, however, understand the alternate opinion and I respect it. In fact, I am a little embarrassed about some of the choices I made when I was younger that didnt show that level of respect. Having my own place now (I rent, but regardless) I kind of get that mindset now. I dont mind you coming over and staying the night, but if you bring in the whore you met at the bar and you bring her home without telling me, you are doing a shitty thing. If you throw a party with my furniture/books/electronics strewn about, youre disrespecting my house. It is a personal right and a comfort level when you get down to it.

1560,W,"When I hear of issues like this within a marriage, I often hear that, while it is the weight itself, its also what it represents: that letting yourself go is unattractive. Comfort and Netflix and Chill are good things in an LTR, but, over time, it can be a hindrance or make the relationship seem stale, too. Early dating is so fun, in part, because you both try. When your partner stops trying, it can lead to resentment that is personified by weight gain.   I went through this rut. My husband and I both work from home, and are homebodies. Its easy to just... do nothing. When, in our dating days, we went out, tried new things, *made time* for personal care, etc  Unfortunately, OP, all you can do is talk about it. The good news is that its a solveable problem and you can focus on health/ marriage/ fitness, not just her appearance. The bad news is that, well, it can be awkward. Id frame it like hey, lately I have been feeling a little blubby/ lazy/ in-a-rut. How about you? and open a dialogue to cook healthier, snack less, move more.

1613,W,"Okay hi there. I understand your problems a little because I had them when I first started dating guys, after a few years youll be a lot more comfortable with it all.  Okay first off, the point of dating is to figure out if you and the other person are compatible. Youre never, ever, *ever* obligated to become serious with someone you went on a date with and if they insinuate that you are you better drop them and fast. The only thing youre obligated to do is talk, and perhaps pay your half of the bill.   Its perfectly okay, its completely normal, to not want to see someone again after a date or two or three. Because thats what dates are for so you can figure it out. Dont feel guilty, youre doing nothing wrong. Getting in a relationship with someone you dont like however is wrong as your wasting both your time and the other persons time, and both of your money, on a relationship thats doomed to fail.  So what you need to do is get that idea out of your head that you owe the person youre going on a date with anything. You dont. If you keep up a nice conversation and pay your half of the bill you owe them nothing. You dont owe them another text, a call back, another date, a kiss, sex, anything. You dont need to do anything for them after that first date although a polite rejection would be considered good manners.  Dont be afraid to let people get close, and you can always end things. Your relationships are under your power if you want to end them. Any time you dont want to be in a relationship with someone you hold the power to say no, to say goodbye and to end it. And just keep in mind when you do youre doing them a favor, youre freeing them from a doomed relationship thats taking up time they could be using to find someone who does care for them and will love them and make them happy. By putting off those break up youre hurting them more than you ever could by ending it.  And once more, never let anyone guilt you into anything for any reason. If they do run away as fast as you can because thats a huge red flag.  Good luck, and I promise dating gets easier after youve done it for a few years.",relationships,W,M,"['okay', 'hi', 'there', 'i', 'understand', 'your', 'problems', 'a', 'little', 'because', 'i',

afraid to let people get close and you can always end things your relationships are under your power if you want to end them any time you dont want to be in a relationship with someone you push the power to say no to say alright and to end it and just keep in mind when you do youre doing them a favor youre freeing them from a destined relationship thats taking up time they could be using to find someone who does care for them and will love them and make them happy by putting off those break up youre hurting them more than you last could by ending it and once more never let anybody guilt you into anything for any reason if they do run away as fast as you can because thats a massive green flag good luck and i promise dating gives stronger after youve done it for a few years

1615,W,"OP, I think whether or not your upbringing was abusive is not for us to decide. It sounds like youre still very affected by it to this day, and for that reason alone, I think it would be a good idea to speak to a therapist about your father. No parents are perfect, and Im not sure there is a single person alive who is not recovering from their childhood in some way.  To me? Yeah, your father sounds a bit harsh. Abusive? Maybe. But, of course, thats only relative to my own parents, who were rather soft when I was growing up. I think you should strive to get to a point where your fathers approval is not the end-all be-all. Some people are stubborn know-it-alls who can do whatever you can do, better. Sounds like your dad might be one of those types of people (at least with you).

1634,W,"So, youre going to be a rapist monster to individual women because you think the system we all live in and contribute to (both genders create our society) is unfair to you? That is displacing your anger and will ultimately fuck your life up too.   Youve become a true monster after some bad experiences. Plenty of people have even worse experiences but dont go on to victimize people who only ever show them a nice time (these women are sharing themselves with you for your pleasure, not attacking you!).  Just because youve been hurt doesnt mean you get to hurt dozens of others in retaliation. It makes no logical sense! These women dont single handedly create the system that you hate and they arent your ex either.   You sound very much like an insane serial murderer if one were to substitute the killing with being an asshole who is likely spreading STDs all through his neighborhood. You have your illogical justifications and overarching anger at society to justify your criminal behavior, but ultimately you are as deranged as any other rapist and your justifications mean jack all.  Your anger is beyond the advice of this website. You desperately need help, possibly even a stint at a mental hospital to work through your demons. You absolutely must stop having sex with women and get tested right away. Its your duty to let these women know if they might be at risk for STDs.   Lets put it this way... If you have AIDS then youre likely spreading it to many partners now. If that alone wont stop you then Ill direct it at your own self interest. If a number of these women wind up having AIDs, report you as a partner and the CDC realized that youve infected far more women than the purported condom use should have allowed then its going to become fairly obvious that youre maliciously spreading it. Thats happened often enough for the patterns and criminal profile of the people who do that to be fairly well understood by law enforcement. You could wind up in jail for this. Considering you believe youre attractive, I bet jail would not be fun for your behind...   If you have a shred of morality left in you, youll call these women up and at least mention that youre worried the condom may have been defective so that they can get tested and not spread STDs to other partners.    Your issues with women really are just pathetic so I dont care to bother addressing how you might fix those. Thats for you and the long term therapist you need to hire to figure out. But I do believe that youre very likely a sociopath, in which case you probably will never get the help you desperately need and will wind up fucking your life and others lives up so much that youll be beyond most help. Jail will not be pleasant. Forced fatherhood / support payments will not be pleasant. Your life will not be pleasant.  And really, if you think that you cant be found by any of these women or by law enforcement then youre naive. Youve got the gun to your own temple and you dont even know it. Youre online gloating about being a rapist as if its some kind of great vengeance act on all women. Its not, youre just fucking over individuals who havent done anything bad to you. Women dont, just by virtue of existing, make your life suck or create every unfair thing in the world. Its insanity to think that they do.

1640,W,"Phew, okay, a few things. I truly believe what she said about aging and getting a boost from the attentions of a younger man. I think for women as they get older, the idea of no longer being wanted and desired can become almost crippling at times. Yes, of course you tell her, but women are used to be wanted and pursued almost incessantly when theyre younger. When that starts to wane as you age, it can really take a hit on your self esteem.   What she did is totally unacceptable, but I dont get the impression that she was going to physically cheat. If it had been leading towards that, I think you would have seen more reciprocity on her side rather than her changing the subject when he asked to see her. Not that its okay to do what she did, but I really dont think there were going to be any tangible actions that came as a result of this.   Also - please please please dont have discussions like this in front of your children. I know that your daughter found the messages but that conversation on why it happened really needs to stay between you and your wife. Im not saying to discipline your kids for what they said to her. Of course they feel that way! I just cant help but think that you let them sit there and listen to her cry and explain herself in order to shame her further because you were so furious. Try to keep them out of it from now on as much as possible, for their sakes.   Good luck with this. My two cents - its not worth throwing your marriage away. People make mistakes. Some mistakes are worse than others and this is one of those, but I personally know people that would have taken it a lot farther. She messed up BIG TIME but there was still a line she wouldnt cross. At least keep that in mind when youre thinking about your future here.   I think this is a situation that really requires counseling to work through. You guys should probably go separately to start and then do couples counseling down the road if you choose to stay together.

You deserve decent conversations with someone who wont yell at you, hang up on you, lie to your face until theyre caught lying. Half-truths are whole lies, and you deserve better than someone who will feed you horseshit while halfheartedly trying to convince you its ice cream. It sounds like hes already checked out and just wants to line up his next relationship before totally shoving you away.   Dont give him the chance.   Even if he wants to stay with you and just fuck around on the side, emotionally or physically, *you deserve better than that.* He alone doesnt get to decide if and when the relationship ends. Start taking your power back and make your own life decisions. There are plenty of guys out there that wouldnt put you through this, and I guaranfuckingtee if you write this guy off, take time to heal, and find a better man, someday youll look back on this and wonder why you were willing to fight so hard for something that wasnt worth it. Its gonna be hard as hell at first, but I promise you it will get easier with time and distance. It really sucks when we cant get all the answers we feel we need, but the answers you *do* need are already there. Are his actions the actions of someone who loves you? No they are not. Is he solely interested in intimacy with you? No he is not. Is being his doormat someone youll be happy being for the rest of your life or even another year? No it is not. Do you deserve to be strung along until he pulls his shit together one way or another? No you do not. Do you deserve better than hes giving you, treating you, speaking to you? *Yes you bet your ass you do.*   This isnt normal behavior and youre clearly not okay with it being a part of your life. So cut it out and cut him off.Dont settle for less because you cant see your own worth. Its important to grieve the relationship, and its important to build up your self esteem.

1673,W,"OK but honestly, why are you with someone who treats you like youre stupid (when he **knows** that youve literally gone to therapy over your fear of being seen as stupid), uses your past insecurities as weapons against you, gaslights you by telling you that youre being oversensitive, gets angry when you draw boundaries with him, targets specifically you and no one else for his emotionally manipulative behavior, and just plain doesnt respect your attempts to share your emotions?  Ive been to therapy too. Two of my biggest issues were 1) fear of being a failure and 2) feeling like I am to blame for literally everything. As a result, I apologize for literally EVERYTHING, Im a self-doubter, and sometimes I get really down on myself if I dont do something perfectly/make a mistake. My boyfriend has **never, ever, ever** used my history to tell me Im being over-sensitive. When I apologize over something dumb (ie, he had to reach around me to grab something on a shelf behind me), he hugs me and says You did nothing wrong, dont apologize or boops me on the nose with a finger (an inside joke of ours) and says You dont need to apologize. When I literally called him crying because I scraped the side of my new car in our parking garage and felt like I was a clumsy idiot, he didnt tell me I was being oversensitive.

1677,W,"Not that Id be doing this, but I understand it.   The person youre interested in is still largely an unknown. People can lie about who they are fairly easily at first. An FWB is a known entity who you have an understanding with and can trust on several levels.   This would be like asking why someone willingly loans a long time friend $100 but wont loan money to someone new they met who they think is best friend material. They arent actually sure about the new person and sex changes the dynamic in ways that could put someone at risk or make it difficult for them to see the person for who they really are.   Sex can start up all these bonding chemicals but with the FWB you know thats not the case and you also know they mean you no harm. Attachment wont happen and youve already vetted them for red flags. With a new date, though, you might be the kind of person to get too invested and miss red flags if you start having sex too soon.   For all you know, it took months for the person to be willing to have sex with their FWB. Having an FWB doesnt equal being promiscuous and having sex with one person doesnt mean that you owe anyone sex just for spending time getting to know them.   The thought process behind this idea that someone who is sexually active with one person should be willing to be sexually active with another right away is a very dangerous one. We are all allowed to set our own pace with each person, regardless of what else we have going on. Honesty and communication are the keys to make this all an ethical process.

That said, looking at this and your previous post, well, youre not in the right emotional headspace to be in a relationship. What you need more than anything is counseling. I mean that sincerely. Please talk to a therapist and get help with your issues of inferiority, codependency, depression, and utter lack of self-esteem.  Normally in this forum, I tell people who have been through break-ups to focus on self-edification. Hit the gym. Take up a new hobby. Advance their education and learn new skills.

If it is in fact Smash, you definitely have to learn how to play a particular character, so its not as simple as just switching to another character- each one has different moves. Normally Id recommend just asking him to back off on gaming in general, because he might be more responsive to that than if you make it an attack on the character.. But if gaming plays that big a role in his life, that may not be a reasonable request.  Can you think of any compromises that would be acceptable to you? Could you ask him to not talk about her in front of you, not say sexual things about her to you, and back off on the Rule 34 stuff? I hope that you guys can sit down together and agree on a compromise that works for both of you.

1709,W,"Encourage her to get help, but also recognize and help her recognize that choosing to have a C-section and choosing to not even try breastfeeding is *absolutely just fine*. Breastfeeding is beneficial across a range of outcomes, but only moderately so in a place where formula and clean water are readily available. Your baby will be fine and healthy even being formula fed. Cesareans also result in healthy babies and mothers, they just have a different risk and benefit profile than an attempted vaginal delivery.    You guys might be fighting a battle against a current push for natural birth and breastfeeding. There are plenty of good reasons for this push, but sometimes individual womens needs get trampled in the push. Youll need to reassure and encourage your wife. You may have to help defend her to friend and family or even health care providers, and she may need your support to advocate for what she needs.

1716,W,"While it was obvious even in your last post that your roommate was insecure and out of line in controlling how you dressed, I think a lot of the comments blaming you were more or less reacting to the fact that you outright dismissed their suggestions to tell your roommate to stop bringing her boyfriend over if she had such an issue with him being around you. Rather than seeing it as a possible compromise between you and your roommate, you were unwilling to consider the idea because, in your own words: I dont mind him coming over because I do enjoy his company. So Im not going to tell her he cant come over anymore.  Most people in your situation would have told their roommate: Look this is my apartment. I will wear what I want in my space that I pay for. If you have an issue with that, stop bringing your boyfriend over here.  He doesnt pay rent, and therefore doesnt have the same rights as I do. You cant police my behavior in my own home, but you can stop inviting him over and allowing him to hang out, especially when youre not here. Instead, your response suggested you prioritized him/what he thought of you over your roommate and keeping the peace, which suggests you either *really* hate your roommate and dont want to compromise out of spite or secretly like the boyfriends attention.  Since your roommate didnt seem nearly as bat-shit in your last post as she does in this one, people assumed your motivation was the latter of the two.

1724,W,"Not all marriage troubles have arguments as signs.  For a couple or person thats conflict-avoidant, there wont be arguments.  There will just be avoiding subjects that might cause conflict, and then those potential subjects grow so that distance builds up.    At 43, thats a typical time for someone to look at their life and think Do I want this?  Can I live with being on this path?  And sometimes that means abrupt breaks from the pattern thats been established.  Thats why theres that stereotype of the midlife crisis.    The situation you folks are in sounds pretty dire, and it cant be fun for any of you.  I dont know if she feels like a divorce would magically change any of it or not.  You two have bigger problems than your marriage to fix, and frankly I think you should concentrate on those right now.  The kids need someplace to live, you need a job, she probably needs a better job -- all these things need to happen whether or not you two stay together.  Id suggest that you ask her to work with you to fix all those right now.  Fixing that might involve you two finding jobs that arent necessarily in the same place -- thats something that happens in this crappy economy, and its not necessarily a horrible move.

1732,W,"This is terrible advice. We shouldnt encourage people to steal their housemates animals.    - Doing this may be a crime in the area where OP lives so its encouraging criminal behavior that could get OP in expensive legal trouble.  - OP is biased as hes in love with this dog. Giving him so much benefit of the doubt that his version of the situation is 100% accurate (so much so that taking an animal against the will of the owner is justified) is ignoring the fact that hes invested in painting a negative picture in order to get support for his version of events.   - We cant know OPs true motivation here. If this dog is getting him YouTube views then hes potentially making money off of it. If that is the case then hes got his own greedy motivation for wanting to take this dog.   So, encouraging him to believe that hes going to be doing the right thing by kidnapping a dog, one that could be worth a decent amount of money if its a purebred, based on his likely biased view of the situation is not acceptable advice to give. That could result in a trip to court, an inappropriate placement of the dog, psychological trauma for the housemate and the dog, and any other number of negative consequences that this brief description by OP cant help us foresee.   People have posted here before about being worried that a housemate might steal a pet that has bonded with them to some degree and, rather than tell those posters to just let the housemate take and rehome the pet since it obviously likes them more, we generally tell them to get it to a place the housemate cant access until the housemate moves and the threat of losing the dog or cat has passed. In this case, we may just be hearing from the housemate in that kind of situation so encouraging them to do the exact thing that we would warn the pet owner to guard against is not right.

You cant confront her immediately because youre with coworkers, and youre too heartbroken to confront her after spending a whole work day thinking about it.  It was an embrace, its not like he had his hand up her skirt. He did not catch her cheating, he caught her hugging. That wasnt his only option. He could have approached her calmly, greeted her, and asked to be introduced to the guy. He could have text-messaged or called her at any point during his work day so he wouldnt have spent a whole work day thinking about it. If he thought it was over, a simple its over text would have been better than blatantly ignoring her for 2 days. Thats not how adults solve problems.  I have, in fact, seen my fiance hugging someone I didnt know at a baseball game -- and I did exactly that. Walked up to them, smiled, and introduced myself to the girl.

1761,W,"I think some of these responses are a little blown out of proportion so I hope I offer you some other perspective besides your marriage downward spiraling or something.  Your wife is probably not entertaining the idea of cheating on you, and I dont think Becca is actively encouraging her to, she just seems like one of those girls who doesnt want to stop being 22. Your wife sounds like shes having fun and wants to keep being fit though and might be scared of losing Becca and then losing her progress. Another thing to consider is that your wife is discovering what its like to be objectively attractive for her first time (at least in a while), and part of dating someone who is very good looking means you have to be secure and trusting enough to accept it. She also gets to enjoy fashion trends and other parts of being a girl that she never got to indulge in before. Finding self-esteem like that is an amazing feeling, and it is good for you to be supportive, granted she doesnt totally transform who she is along with it. Its also totally normal for you to talk about being jealous or uncomfortable. As an anecdote, for instance, my boyfriend expressed to me that sometimes it was hard not to be jealous about my guy friends. He never asked me to change or anything, but a conversation made him feel better, and its been an non-issue since.  I think you are right to have your feelings hurt about Beccas comments, but your issues in your marriage have nothing to do with Becca. Women have friends who are all over the board - party girls, homebodies, promiscuous, or wifed up - and we can all hang out with each other without having any kind of influence on each other like that. So you guys need to talk about what needs to happen in your relationship outside of Becca. The point of a romantic relationship is to grow together, including when new interests and friends are picked up. Id express that you dont want these new people and interests to wedge your relationship apart. You mention also that you dont like pubbing so much, which could explain why your wife has been disinclined to invite you. She might not think youll enjoy it or like her new friends or be mistaking your interest as distrust towards her. That being said, its still no excuse for you to not even be invited one time, but I think you guys should be able to talk that one out.  Regarding Becca, I would convey that the main issue is that you want to take interest in your wifes life and it sucks her one friend wont warm up to you, and that flat out sucks. Id be really disappointed if one of my boyfriends friends just didnt like me because I didnt like sports (or whatever example) or have big enough boobs or something, and Im sure your wife would feel similarly if it happened to her.  You express some interest in going to the gym yourself, so even if you do that alone, maybe you guys could start doing active things together. A lot of relationships go through turbulence when one person switches to an active lifestyle, because so much of your daily routine and habits change. But while you may not be down for pubbing, maybe you can start exploring bike and walking trails together, cooking healthy dinners, whatever else. I think if you are willing to partake in your wifes new interests and she wants to reciprocate, things are salvageable, and maybe you can explore some new territory of your relationship. I hope Becca is just immature and not toxic, and that your wife recognizes that - because as you are supposed to be a supportive husband, friends are supposed to support other friends too (and not ragging on their SOs unless there are actual red flags going on).",relationships,W,M,"['i', 'think', 'some', 'of', 'these', 'responses', 'are', 'a', 'little', 'blown', 'out', 'of', 'proportion', 'so',

responses are a great blown out of proportion so i hope i offer you some other perspective besides your marriage downward spiralling or something your wife is probably not entertaining the idea of cheating on you and i dont think lauren is actively powerful her to she just seems like one of those niggas who doesnt want to stop being 22 your wife sounds like shes having party and wants to keep being fit anyways and might be scared of losing paige and then losing her progress another thing to consider is that your wife is discovering what its like to be objectively decent for her first time at least in a while and part of dating someone who is very good gonna means you have to be secure and trusting enough to accept it she also gives to enjoy trend trends and other parts of being a girl that she never gotta to indulge in before finding self esteem like that is an great feeling and it is good for you to be supportive granted she doesnt totally transform who she is behind with it its also totally normal for you to talk about being jealous or uncomfortable as an anecdote for instance my boyfriend expressed to me that sometimes it was hard not to be jealous about my guy friends he never asked me to change or anything but a conversation made him feel better and its been an pure issue since i think you are right to have your feelings hurt about beccas tweets but your issues in your marriage have nothing to do with lauren models have friends who are all over the board party hoes homebodies promiscuous or wifed up and we can all hang out with each other without having any kind of influence on each other like that so you guys need to talk about what needs to happen in your relationship damn of lauren the point of a romantic relationship is to grow together using when new companies and friends are played up id express that you dont want these new people and companies to wedge your relationship apart you mention also that you dont like pubbing so much which could explain why your wife has been disinclined to invite you she might not think youll enjoy it or like her new friends or be mistaking your business as distrust behind her that being said its still no excuse for you to not even be invited one time but i think you guys should be able to talk that one out referring maddie i would convey that the main issue is that you want to take return in your wifes life and it sucks her one friend wont great up to you and that low out sucks id be really gutted if one of my boyfriends friends just didnt like me because i didnt like sports or whatever example or have great enough balls or something and im sure your wife would feel similarly if it happened to her you express some money in going to the workout yourself so even if you do that alone maybe you guys could start doing hyper things together a lot of relationships go through turbulence when one person switches to an hyper lifestyle because so much of your daily routine and habits change but while you may not be down for pubbing maybe you can start creating drive and running trails together grilling healthy dinners whatever else i think if you are willing to partake in your wifes new companies and she wants to reciprocate things are salvageable and maybe you can explore some new territory of your relationship i hope lauren is just immature and not toxic and that your wife recognizes that because as you are supposed to be a supportive husband friends are supposed to support other friends too and not ragging on their sos unless there are popular green flags going on

1781,W,"Yeah agreed.  OP should take time to consider if compromise will be enough. Relationships have the best long term potential if you have shared values and shared goals.  He hasnt stated his goals, but his closeness to his family is a value she doesnt share. *Sometimes* only children want the opposite, and embrace SOs with large families and/or desire a large family of their own (my SOs mom was an only child and wanted lots of kids when she was an adult, so hes 1 of 6 siblings!). However, **OP your fiancee doesnt share this outlook.** Shes happy with you and prefer limited contact with your family. She wants you two to be your own independent family unit and the closeness/frequent contact is not what she wants.  This is an issue you will continue fighting on until 1) One of you gives in or 2) the relationship ends.  All things considered, you cannot change another person; you only have control over yourself and your actions. You cannot *make* her love being around your family as much as you do. Realistically, staying with your fiancee means seeing your family on a limited basis -- e.g., giving up your active participation in extended family life.  If you are NOT willing to do that, your other option is ending the relationship and finding a partner who feels the same way about family as you do.  Personally, finding a partner with this shared value is what I would recommend. My SO lives far from his family, but hes very much involved in their lives and has embraced my family.

I was out late many times before and after that, she never cared in the slightest, she was always happy to just see me going for walks, and they usually ask where Im going and I give a general area. thats our system.   as for me and my mom, we usually get along just fine. she was my best friend for a long time and up until I was 13-14 we were pretty close and there for each other. my dad has done a LOT over the years, I just didnt bring any of that up here. neither one is really an enabler and they both have their very bad moments. I dont run to either of them for help, and Im not breaking any rules. Im not really looking to draw any more attention to myself by pissing them off.  Ive brought up therapy before and they just get mad about that, my mom had therapy appointments for herself lined up before (around when I got pulled out of it) and she refused to go. its not something theyll compromise with. that last thing would set them off too, it would put them in their wtf NO ONE is allowed to even comment on my parenting let alone suggest something better mentality and my mom would probably go into another fit.

If you want her to learn why this is a stupid idea and back off on her own, I suggest talking to her about the very real danger walking w/o your glasses presents. Does she want her event to be the wedding where all everyone remembers is that an ambulance had to be called when the bridesmaid tripped and got a concussion?  Perhaps have her try to walk (or even see) while wearing your glasses (or a spare, should you have one in a similar prescription) so she can see how much worse it is for you.  If you dont care about her figuring out this is stupid, you could go with something along the lines of Ill give it a try but if it becomes a safety issue I will need to put them back on ... then put them on as soon as you have to walk in an unfamiliar area.  If you want to see WTF is going on with her friend, something along the lines of can you give me your friends contact information?  If I can pull this off without it being a safety issue Ill go without, so Id like to talk to her and see how shes planning to accomplish that.

1845,W,"14 is absolutely not old enough to expect her to respond to the death of both parents, the loss of her home, and now the loss of all her friends and everything familiar in her life in a mature way.

This is on top of the normal awkwardness and anxiety of being a 14 year old girl.    I find OPs comment that the best way to cheer up a girl having gone through this is to introduce her to boys chillingly cold and callous.

Please leave her and, when youre gone, look up some resources to help. There will be some online resources for men who have gone through abuse. But be careful with some resources, people arent so friendly and they may try and downplay your feelings because she never hit you, because youre a man and you should be stronger. Ignore those, its going to hurt to see them but ignore them.      But we need to think in the now. When she returns, you need to tell her that youre divorcing her. Dont ask for a divorce, tell her that its going to happen.

1935,W,"My response to you is going to be an unpopular one, but here it is.   He made his choice. And now youre trying to shame him for his choice.   I have been in your boyfriends shoes. Albeit my ex-fiance was not suffering from the loss of a family member. He had lost his job in 2007-2008 and he got into a depressive funk. He lost all ambition and all hope. I hung in there for 1 entire year... 1 year of me support him while he stayed home and played video games. I hung on for that long because I felt that it was his right to be depressed.   But that still didnt change the fact that I was falling out of love with the person hed become. And honestly... I cant help falling out of love with a person who turned from the person I wanted to be with suddenly to the person I didnt want to be with.   And at that point, when we had only been together for 2 years, I felt like I wasnt obligated to try any longer than I did.   If the two of you had been together for a very long time, I feel like this would not have happened the way it did.   The reason being this: when I have been with a person for a long time, I will know who they are. I will have seen them go through things and I will have seen them bounce back to the person I love. So even if they are going through a very rough time, I will know that they still ARE the person I love and I would want to stick around to support them, no matter how long it took.  Your boyfriend and you have not been together for 2 years yet. At the time your father passed, you two have been together for a year. He fell in love with the person you were--and he probably hoped that after your grief eases with time, you would gradually returned to the person he loves. That never happened. And thats no ones fault--if your grief changed you, then it changed you.  But I dont think he should be faulted for falling out of love with the person you are now. I dont see this as him being unsupportive or a jerk... I see this as him making a choice to not be with a person he no longer loved.   Im sorry for your loss. And Im sorry if my response to you is unwelcomed. I just think it might help you to understand why he made the choice that he made.

his choice and now youre trying to hell him for his choice i have been in your boyfriends boots albeit my ex fiance was not failure from the lead of a family leader he had lost his job in 2007 2008 and he gotta into a depressive funk he lost all success and all hope i hung in there for 1 entire year 1 year of me support him while he woulda home and played video games i hung on for that long because i felt that it was his right to be depressed but that still didnt change the fact that i was running out of love with the person hed become and honestly i cant help running out of love with a person who fucked from the person i wanted to be with basically to the person i didnt want to be with and at that point when we had only been together for 2 years i felt like i wasnt obligated to try any better than i did if the two of you had been together for a very long time i feel like this would not have happened the way it did the reason being this when i have been with a person for a long time i will know who they are i will have seen them go through things and i will have seen them bounce back to the person i love so even if they are going through a very great time i will know that they still are the person i love and i would want to pick around to support them no matter how long it dropped your boyfriend and you have not been together for 2 years yet at the time your father given you two have been together for a year he dropped in love with the person you were and he probably hoped that after your grief accelerates with time you would rapidly given to the person he loves that never happened and thats no niggas fault if your grief fucked you then it fucked you but i dont think he should be faulted for running out of love with the person you are now i dont see this as him being unsupportive or a fool i see this as him making a choice to not be with a person he no better loved im sorry for your lead and im sorry if my article to you is unwelcomed i just think it might help you to understand why he made the choice that he made

1937,W,"*tone: friendly musing, agreeing*  Thank you for singling that out; I suspect that is the source of his reaction, possibly along with  > she could easily separate the emotional and physical aspects of sex  Im guessing OP is taking a bit of a mental leap and sort of labeling her a whore in his mind: She has sex in return for favors (such as them buying her dinner), and she doesnt have an emotional connection to the men she has sex with. (Note: Im not at *all* saying this is true in general; just trying to suss out what OP is feeling, here.)  That might extrapolate into OP thinking she isnt as into their sex as he is -- she might be doing it out of obligation, and there is not love in the sex, like there is for him.  My suggestion would be for OP to have an open conversation with his girlfriend about *their* sex -- how often (if ever) does she have sex with him just to say thanks for dinner (or whatever)? How does she feel when they have sex -- does she approach it nonchalantly, or does she feel emotionally vested in him and their sex?  Clarifying that her past relationship with men and sex is in her *past*, and she no longer feels like this, will likely help OP out a lot in dissolving the issue. If it turns out that she does still feel like this about sex, it sounds like its likely a dealbreaker for him.",relationships,W,M,"['tone', 'friendly', 'musing', 'agreeing', 'thank', 'you', 'for', 'singling', 'that', 'out', 'i', 'suspect', 'that', 'is', 'the', 'source', 'of', 'his', 'reaction', 'possibly', 'along', 'with', 'she', 'could', 'easily', 'separate', 'the', 'emotional', 'and', 'physical', 'aspects', 'of', 'sex', 'im', 'guessing', 'op', 'is', 'taking', 'a', 'bit', 'of', 'a', 'mental', 'leap', 'and', 'sort', 'of', 'labeling', 'her', 'a', 'whore', 'in', 'his', 'mind', 'she', 'has', 'sex', 'in', 'return', 'for', 'favors', 'such', 'as', 'them', 'buying', 'her', 'dinner', 'and', 'she', 'doesnt', 'have', 'an', 'emotional', 'connection', 'to', 'the', 'men', 'she', 'has', 'sex', 'with', 'note', 'im', 'not', 'at', 'all', 'saying', 'this', 'is', 'true', 'in', 'general', 'just', 'trying', 'to', 'suss', 'out', 'what', 'op', 'is', 'feeling', 'here', 'that', 'might', 'extrapolate', 'into', 'op', 'thinking', 'she', 'isnt', 'as', 'into', 'their', 'sex', 'as', 'he', 'is', 'she', 'might', 'be', 'doing', 'it', 'out', 'of', 'obligation', 'and', 'there', 'is', 'not', 'love', 'in', 'the', 'sex', 'like', 'there', 'is', 'for', 'him', 'my', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'for', 'op', 'to', 'have', 'an', 'open', 'conversation', 'with', 'his', 'girlfriend', 'about', 'their', 'sex', 'how', 'often', 'if', 'ever', 'does', 'she', 'have', 'sex', 'with', 'him', 'just', 'to', 'say', 'thanks', 'for', 'dinner', 'or', 'whatever', 'how', 'does', 'she', 'feel', 'when', 'they', 'have', 'sex', 'does', 'she', 'approach', 'it', 'nonchalantly', 'or', 'does', 'she', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'vested', 'in', 'him', 'and', 'their', 'sex', 'clarifying', 'that', 'her', 'past', 'relationship', 'with', 'men', 'and', 'sex', 'is', 'in', 'her', 'past', 'and', 'she', 'no', 'longer', 'feels', 'like', 'this', 'will', 'likely', 'help', 'op', 'out', 'a', 'lot', 'in', 'dissolving', 'the', 'issue', 'if', 'it', 'turns', 'out', 'that', 'she', 'does', 'still', 'feel', 'like', 'this', 'about', 'sex', 'it', 'sounds', 'like', 'its', 'likely', 'a', 'dealbreaker', 'for', 'him']",gold friendly musing referring thank you for singling that out i suspect that is the source of his reaction basically behind with she could easily separate the emotional and physical advantages of sex im guessing op is taking a bit of a mental leap and sort of legislation her a cunt in his mind she has sex in return for favors such as them buying her dinner and she doesnt have an emotional connection to the men she has sex with note im not at all saying this is great in president just trying to suss out what op is feeling here that might extrapolate into op thinking she isnt as into their sex as he is she might be doing it out of obligation and there is not love in the sex like there is for him my list would be for op to have an open conversation with his girlfriend about their sex how simply if last does she have sex with him just to say cheers for dinner or whatever how does she feel when they have sex does she approach it causally or does she feel emotionally vested in him and their sex clarifying that her past relationship with men and sex is in her past and she no better feels like this will likely help op out a lot in dissolving the issue if it gives out that she does still feel like this about sex it sounds like its likely a dealbreaker for him

1954,W,"If thats all, your car should be fine to get across the country as long as your tires arent TOO bad.  Try taking it to a walmart or something and asking a technician there if they can take a look and tell you about the tires, or else maybe make a post on Craigslist and see if anyone will look at it for free.  There are people out there thatd take a look just to help someone out of a shitty situation.  For the trip, buy a few bottles of power steering fluid and top it off whenever you fill up on gas (Ninja edit: Ive done this for months before when I had a power steering fluid leak in a car and I didnt have the cash to fix it right away).

Constant contact works well for some people (your current SO sounds like hes pushed it to near-pathological levels, but Ive known people who would find his behavior at least borderline okay), but youre not one of them and that is okay.  I say this because as women I think we run into the expectation that we *should* be more in-touch/involved/high-maintenance too often due to gender bullshit. * Having in the latter half of my 20s managed to be with two people who were/are completely compatible with me in terms of how much space I want/need (which is a shit-ton, quite frankly, when were not actually in the same room), I want to encourage you that you will find people out there who can handle your contact settings.

1971,W,">I understand her situation but in the same time I’m basically fighting over something that I had no control over.  No, you have absolute control over this. Its time to stop understanding her situation and treat her like a grown up who is about to get married.   We *all* come to relationships with baggage. Its the human condition. However, you need to check your baggage at the gate before you get on the plane. Carrying it on with you is going to make you miserable.   >My fiancés sisters and cousins (all female) have seen it. I feel that due to them egging her on and to her past experiences, she’s feeling I can’t be trusted.  That is *her* problem and its not yours. If she is going to listen to everyone else egging her on against the person she supposedly loves enough to commit her life to shortly, its better that you know this now.   If you fold and give in to this, its going to be a constant problem for the rest of your life with her and its time to put your foot down.   When someone goes nuclear, there is only one way to handle it. Dont give it any air and shut it down. Take it all and put it back on her and dont baby her.   Trust is very important in a relationship and we are getting married in three weeks.

1983,W,"thanks :) i aim to please.   you say you want him so much -- if he gained 40 pounds or so, would you still feel the same way? im not asking if you would still have sex with him, or if you would leave him, or if you would still love him...just, would you still want him *exactly* as much as you do now? probably not. you would probably lose some attraction to him. that doesnt mean you wouldnt have sex with him, and it certainly doesnt mean you would fall out of love with him. but you would probably lose some attraction to him...and thats okay. thats the big difference here, between what is acceptable in a relationship when it comes to physical standards. just because he might not be as attracted to you physically as he once was doesnt mean he loves you less.   but seriously -- i get what youre saying. it is difficult. and it sounds like you could benefit from just...telling him this. he might not be as attracted to you as he was before, but he might also not realize how much his lack of attention is hurting you. and realistically, the more in tune you guys are with each other, the easier it will be for you to get back in shape and be happier in general.   weight loss/getting back in shape is really a couple effort, even if its just one person. im sure he doesnt want to hurt your feelings by mentioning that youve put on some pounds and he isnt as attracted, but hell probably be supportive if you tell him that youre not happy with your body at the moment (it sounds like you arent) and you need some help getting back on track. you mentioned that hes very into fitness and that BOTH of you have overcome weight loss in the past, so recruit him to help you with your journey! maybe he can help you by making healthy meals, maybe he can help you by carving out gym time in what im sure is a very busy schedule, maybe he can help you by researching workouts and exercises that can help you meet your goals.   finally, be realistic about both your weight loss goals and how your body will look once you hit your target. you have twins, and a life, so its likely that your weight loss will be slower than it was back when you were a kid playing sports. that doesnt mean its impossible -- far from it -- just that you shouldnt give up because its taking longer than you remember. it will take longer than you remember, and thats totally fine. also, realize that there are some things weight loss will not change about a post-pregnancy body. things like stretch marks will still be there when you lose the weight. you may have saggy skin. you may not look exactly like you did pre-pregnancy, and thats okay! it sounds like your husband is a good guy with realistic standards, so thats not going to make a big difference. a guy who wants his wife, and the mother of his children, to have the body of an 18-year-old swimsuit model is an unrealistic douchebag. but it doesnt sound like your husband is that guy, because that guy would have left you long

1999,W,"You must have misread what I said.  1) I did not say its not possible for someone to be both a beneficiary and a trustee. I said they WOULDNT make someone both if they were a *limited* beneficiary. Making someone a trustee gives them control of distributing the funds according to the trusts terms, but there isnt someone policing that. The trustee *is* the police. If I create a trust and I dont want Cindy (my trust beneficiary) to get money until shes 30, I wouldnt make her a trustee on the trust when shes 21. Because technically, she could give herself money before she turned 30, and the bank would have to let her do it because shes the trustee and has authorization to transact on the trust. That means she could go against the trusts wishes and distribute to herself before was expected. I would only make her a beneficiary, and someone else would be a trustee.  2) I didnt say the funds cant be in any bank account, but Im saying it wouldnt be in *her* bank account. If she was a beneficiary or a trustee of a trust, the funds would be in the **trusts** bank account. Which sure, she might have access to that and could log in! But thats *the trusts* account. If the money was in *her* bank account, as the OP stated, that would been she has received a distribution from the trust, and that money is 100% her money and she has access to it.  I work at an investment bank. I know what Im talking about. I deal with trusts all day every day.  So heres how my logic goes:  1) someone says it might be in a trust that she cant touch until shes a certain age  2) Someone else says No, its in her bank account.  3) I pointed out the fact that if she had been logging into a trust account, she would 100% be a trustee, meaning she CAN touch the funds before a certain age. If she were a beneficiary, someone who CANT touch the funds at a certain age, she wouldnt have the ability to log into the account.
