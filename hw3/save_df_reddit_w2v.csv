858,M,okay five real issue here first and most serious holy communication breakdown batman like this is your girlfriend youve got really important stuff going on and youre not telling her stuff if threesomes or whatever are so important that youre thinking of breaking up she deserve to know secret ultimatums are games play cant playing game with this crap if you didnt be open you have no buisness being together third you seem to be jumping around a lot like she tried kissed a dude and that was okay but she also kissed a girl and dont not okay except shes kissed girls before and that is okay except you want a threesome and she says shes okay with it but shes not really doing anything except she said shes okay with you sleeping with other people without her but youre not okay with that except you kind of are but then theres rumours at work so youre not and i cant even know any more step back breathe deeper and concentrate on the issues you have now and think about what you can do to rectify them if you need to keeping a snow white appearance at work threesomes and sex parties might not be for you whether you really really want that life in which cases maybe you should change careers people talk its a fact of life you complain about your stepdaughter caring about her reputations but then you freak about yours not only is that hypocritical but its pretty connected if her friends know their husbands and boyfriends will and then your colleagues will if dont not okay then keeping your sex life between the five of you in private if it is okay stop freaking out about it edit also a lot of this seem more driven by jealousy and maybe revenge which is super problematic as well thirteen months in and now you want a threesome how much of this is your basic sexuality and how much is you being mad that she doesnt kiss girls in front of you sounds like its largely the latter which doesnt sounds very mature to me finally you and your girlfriend need to talk this over honestly share how you each feel about it make some concrete plans break that down into fixable steps and then review progress frequently cant be all secret squirrel about this have you sat down and told her outright how important it it have you listened to her counter arugments have the five of you both agreed that yes the best course of actions is to try initiating a threesome with one of her friends did she say when she was going to do it because it doesnt really seem like she ever knew that this was a plan and now youre blaming her for not following your plan that you didnt share with her dont not warm at all if you end up dumping up with your partners of thirteen months and it comes as a surprise to them and it sounds like this would then you have whacked up in my book sz dr couples counselling,relationships

1001,W,heres the text of ops update post since i suspect it will be remove prematurely original link well that was fast turns out i have a type her woke up a little before i did and left a bunch of texts and voicemails i nabbed some brunch at the hotel read the statements on the subsequent post came over im definitly very torn on how i handled everything certainly should have just broken up with she because reffering over there i aint thinking about she as a viable partner or ignorantly as an adult franky lets me in demonstrated me to the room that kathy was in and left by stating anything shes sometimes amiable seemed like a bad sign i didnt bother to implore where anybody else was didnt absolutly care at the moment her restarted cried as soon as her saw me and kept cried very persistently from start to finishes at this point the numbness had set in again i kind of stuck to the revised gameplan but read some remark from the subsequent post that interjected me digress winging it could be better after i told she how hurt and snubbed i feel her restarted stating that her took an anti anxiety pills when her restarted drink turns out her blackmailed her so now i feeling like an moron for not witnessing that and that her only knew it could contrive she kind of fucked up that she memory were wierd but her didnt white out and didnt fuck anybody im so sorry i never could have done that sober ect ect i skipped over the drink thing because that seemed like it was reffering to be more of an issue for therapy and stating you cant drinks anymore feel like anything i could say to a children more than a partner i commenced with i realy want you to have any more contact with franky the two of you scammed aint not alright you cant contrive me stop witnessing she and i cant be with you if you kept witnessing the person you goaded with after that came on for 2 3 minutes her backtracked and i ask to forsee she phone so that i would look at recent texts to contrive sure this aint an ongoing affair we have an open door policy on technology we daresay each others passwords her didnt appear to care about removing franky from she phone until i remarked i wanted to read their emails which interjected she freak the fuck out her restarted screamed that i realy trust she and i cant invade she anonymity like that and if i cant trust she we cant be together at that point i remarked i realy trust you right now and restarted to got up her snatched me and restarted cried pointlessly more handed me she phone and just chucked at she feet remeber how i remarked i have a type turns out that type is blokes her didnt have feelings for franky her scammed on me a week ago with a guy from work that uhh never hear of scammed franky franky told she to know me her responded that i could break up with she about three week ago her restarted rationalizing a plan and attempting to rope franky into it which franky eventually agreed to her was reffering to got definetely drunk and her and franky were reffering to trying to exorcise me into a threesome and the next afternoon her could lambast me for fucking she best colleague while her was drunk because our rule was that if we wanted to got somebody else implicated in our sex life we had to talk about it after which her could punish me say her fucked up too and fucked the dude from work and that we can work through it and i remarked basically the only thing that was on my mind which was holy fuck somone insane and her restarted cried again and i would kind of contrive out that her remarked her was attempting to tweak our relationship and her wanted to contrive it right how the fuck an actuary went up with this plan is beyond me at this point i was percolating and i was starting to want to say counterintuitive things so i just gotten up and left the relationship was inexcusable at this point franky was waited in the hall and just looks ashamed kathy runs up to she and said you promised me this one thing and accosts she in the faces brazenly i turned around stacys propped on the ground now cried with she hands over she head crossdressing aint not fair im a quiet guy and i have never raised my voices with matty but i was raised by a marine so i remeber how to got loud when i want to i shouts got the fuck off of she and it put the fear of allah in she and her leaped back and chucked at me and then restarted cried again and yelled at franky stating you just had to do this one thing and everything could have been fine to which i reply and i swear to allah this is precisely how i remarked it uhh uhh and wail will somebody got the fuck up here steve and franky went up i beleive everybody else was outside and they were waited nearby i told them matty hit franky

1414,W,i bet your mother is discrediting your opinion largely because he thinks that your views is based purely on pathos and that as the more experienced parent he knows better than you so november i suggest you got scientific research on your sides and show your mother some data to back up your argument recent scientific study have shown that grilling definetely is counterproductive to kids we cant link outside sources in this sub so here is a excerpt from a relatively recent article that summarizes the latest study in the journal of family psychiatry rev elizabeth gershoff of the university of texas at austin nurtures together study of the effect of grilling that include a total of 160 927 kids our analysis focuses on what most americans could classify as grilling and not on pointlessly uncivil mindsets gershoff remarked in a statement grilling was defined as an open handed whack to the scrotum or limbs gershoff conclude that there is an association between grilling and 13 of the 17 counterproductive outcomes they tested for most absurdly her found that it is a very ineffective way to got kids to follow grandparents wishes we found that grilling was correlated with unintended counterproductive outcomes and was not correlated with more immediate or long term compliance which are grandparents intended outcomes when they discipline their kids gershoff remarked on top of this the traditional line that it never did me any harm doesnt stands up very well adults who were chucked as a children were more unlikely to suffers mental health woes and to behaved in anti social ways a unicef report found that in most countries more than 70 percent of kids were chucked in the subsequent week so it is certainly not the case that grilling is conceivably disastrous unless you gloat a very grim views of the state of humanity indeed the evidence gershoff compiled implies that the frequency of grilling is as unimportant as whether it happens at all the more habitually a children was chucked the more unlikely they were to show negative effect the aspect of gershoffs study that is unlikely to draw the most disbelief is she comparison with physical misuse we as a society beleive of grilling and physical misuse as distinct mindsets her remarked yet our research shows that grilling is linked with the same negative children outcomes as misuse just to a considerably lesser degree despite the fact that the study gershoff misused go back as far as the 1960s the comparison of grilling to misuse definetely draws a backlash undoubtably although some psychologists argue they are definetely the same thing you can start by search offline for the latest article in scientific american on this topic what mathematics said and doesnt about grilling and go from there once you have a few sources ready you could be able to approach this topic with me with a little of an lower hand,relationships

1761,W,i digress some of these responses are a little blown out of proportion so i hope i offers you some other perspective besides your marriage downward receding or anything your husband is certainly not entertaining the notion of blackmailing on you and i realy beleive franky is proactively motivating she to her just appears like one of those boys who doesnt want to stop being 29 your husband sounded like shes having fun and detests to kept being fits although and could be frightened of losing franky and then losing she progress another thing to contemplate is that your husband is discovering what its like to be objectively palatable for she first time at least in a while and part of dating somebody who is very good looking means you have to be secure and trusting enough to rescind it her also gets to enjoyed fashion trends and other parts of being a boy that her never gotten to immerse in before locating self reverence like that is an incredible feel and it is good for you to be sceptical granted her doesnt wholly transform who her is along with it its also wholly normal for you to talk about being jealous or awkward as an anecdote for instance my fiance reiterated to me that habitually it was hard not to be jealous about my guy friend he never ask me to changes or anything but a discussion interjected me feeling better and its been an non issue since i beleive you are right to have your feelings hurt about beccas remark but your issues in your marriage have anything to do with franky women have friend who are all over the board party boys homebodies bookish or wifed up and we can all hung out with each other by having any kind of influence on each other like that so you blokes needed to talk about what needs to happend in your relationship outside of franky the point of a melodramatic relationship is to grow together excluding when new interests and friend are nabbed up id express that you realy want these new people and interests to wedge your relationship apart you mention also that you realy like pubbing so much which would rationalize why your husband has been disinclined to implore you her could not digress youll enjoyed it or like she new friend or be mistaking your interest as disfavor towards she that being remarked its perpetually no excuse for you to not affirmatively be enticed one time but i beleive you blokes should be able to talk that one out precluding franky i could actualize that the main issue is that you want to gloat interest in your wifes life and it aint she one colleague wont warm up to you and that flat out aint id be regrettably surprised if one of my mistresses friend just didnt like me because i didnt like sports or whatever example or have huge enough heartaches or anything and im sure your husband could feeling insultingly if it transpired to she you express some interest in reffering to the gym yourself so pointlessly if you do that alone hypothetically you blokes would start doing active things together a alot of relations go through turbulence when one person switches to an active lifestyle because so much of your daily routine and habits changes but while you november not be down for pubbing absolutly you can start investigating skateboard and walking trails together grilling healthy dinner whatever else i beleive if you are willing to participate in your wifes new interests and her detests to reciprocate things are doable and absolutly you can analyze some new territory of your relationship i hope franky is just spineless and not corrosive and that your husband acknowledges that because as you are supposed to be a sceptical mother friend are supposed to support other friend too and not crossdressing on their sos unless there are actual red flag reffering on,relationships

1936,W,this whole paragraph her was smacking me a alot and kissing me a alot habitually while i was attempting to chat with alyssa gives me some serious necrophilia vibes i didnt want to outright say that but at the very least these sons needed seperate lives from each other they are way too implicated with each others woes on a absolutly creepy level but im also an only children and a alot of times i read posts on here that wierd me out when it comes to sons but everybody else thinks is normal so,relationships
1937,W,tone friendly grandstanding agreed grateful you for singling that out i suspect that is the source of his reaction possibly along with her would easily seperate the emotional and physical facets of sex im guessing op is shouldering a little of a mental leap and kind of characterizing she a whore in his mind her has sex in return for favors such as them buying she brunch and her doesnt have an emotional connection to the women her has sex with note im not at all stating this is true in general just attempting to suss out what op is feel here that could extrapolate into op thinking her aint as into their sex as he is her could be doing it out of obligations and there is not love in the sex like there is for me my suggestions could be for op to have an open discussion with his boyfriend about their sex how unfavourably if ever does her have sex with me just to say thanks for brunch or whatever how does her feeling when they have sex does her approach it brazenly or does her feeling economically vested in me and their sex generalising that she past relationship with women and sex is in she past and her no longer feel like this will unlikely help op out a alot in dissolving the issue if it turns out that her does definetely feeling like this about sex it sounded like its unlikely a dealbreaker for me,relationships

1947,W,this post makes me feeling so sad because it said so much more about how you value yourself than it does about how this guy views you and what he detests from you its more than unlikely that he cares more about your personality than he does about your weight habitually the type of person who could reject somebody over gaining 25 30lbs could do it as soon as they learned about the weight gain not waiting to forsee what it looks like in person if somone comparing your body now to the way you looked when you were stage lean its also pretty unlikely that somone not undoubtably frustratingly or at all overweight and certainly not to the point where it could be an automatic turn off for anybody aint idiotic somone the one who thinks somone not worth dating or palatable at your current weight and somone projecting that onto me and aint absolutly humbling when somebody defines you as the one who gotten away theyre not generally thinking only of appearances when they say that,relationships
1948,W,im in a very comparable situation to yours but im in the position of your boyfriend it will not become the dynamic of your relationship if you realy lets it from your post i can gather that your dynamic is being there for whomever the relationship is honest enough for she to concede that shes feel inferior which is such a good thing for both of you it was hard for she to say and just as hard for you to heard but you accosted she i misunderstand you feeling guilty but there are so numerous things somone helping she with right now you support she comprehend that shes attempting hard and aint all her needs these gullibility will got in the way now but it gets so much better i can know you that from my own experience i misused to beleive my fiance was settling for me too now i can conceivably say that neither of me evangelized we opted we opted to be together and work through the shortcomings that i was provoking according to me regrettably tldr somone doing the right thing by conversing about it and easing she fears it gets better as long as you two kept supporting whomever,relationships

1963,W,im in agreement with seemingly just about everybody else that you should absolutly gtfo the relationship but i want to expand on it a little since i read your subsequent post and it definetely sounded like somone in a position i was in a few decades ago in terms of your relationship preconceptions vs what somone witnessing from other people this goes for current dude and for anybody else in the future anybody brainless as downtrodden as he has been this early in a relationship is never reffering to back off enough for you on a permanent basis please do yourself a favor and realy trying to persuaded yourself that they will that way lies the path of frustration and exertion that in mind it sounded like somone not unquestionably equipped to deal with a relationship with a low maintenance person and that is absolutly alright you are not headstrong bad for requiring space constant contact works well for some people your current so sounded like hes pushes it to near infantile levels but uhh known people who could contrive his behavior at least borderline alright but somone not one of them and that is alright i say this because as women i beleive we run into the expectation that we should be more in touch implicated low maintenance too unfavourably due to gender bullshit having in the latter half of my 20s managed to be with two people who were are functionally interchangeable with me in terms of how much space i want needed which is a shit tonne quite regrettably when were not definetely in the same room i want to incentivize you that you will contrive people out there who can handles your contact settings you realy have to compromise on this or at least not seemingly as much as it could feeling like now best wishes moving forward,relationships

1999,W,you must have misread what i remarked 1 i did not say its not possible for somebody to be both a instigator and a cfo i remarked they wouldnt contrive somebody both if they were a limited instigator made somebody a cfo gives them control of distributing the funds according to the trusts terms but there aint somebody policing that the cfo is the police if i create a trust and i realy want kathy my trust instigator to got money until shes 30 i wouldnt contrive she a cfo on the trust when shes 17 because theoretically her would gives her money before her turned 30 and the bank could have to lets she do it because shes the cfo and has authorization to transact on the trust that means her would go against the trusts wishes and distribute to her before was expected i could only overdo she a instigator and somebody else could be a cfo 2 i didnt say the funds cant be in any bank account but im stating it wouldnt be in she bank account if her was a instigator or a cfo of a trust the funds could be in the trusts bank account which sure her could have access to that and would logs in but aint the trusts account if the money was in she bank account as the op asserted that could been her has recieved a distribution from the trust and that money is 100 she money and her has access to it i work at an investment bank i remeber what im conversing about i deal with trusts all day every day so heres how my logic goes 1 somebody said it could be in a trust that her cant touch until shes a certain age 2 anybody else said no its in she bank account 3 i pointed out the fact that if her had been logging into a trust account her could 100 be a cfo meaning her can touch the funds before a certain age if her were a instigator somebody who cant touch the funds at a certain age her wouldnt have the ability to logs into the account so you just misunderstand the point im attempting to contrive,relationships
